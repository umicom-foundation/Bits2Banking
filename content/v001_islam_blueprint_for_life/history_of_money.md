# Chapter 2 — History of Money (5,000 Years) and Islam’s Ethic of Trade

Money is a tool. In righteous hands and just systems, it enables exchange, investment, and prosperity. In corrupt systems, it becomes an engine of exploitation. Islam enters this story with a **moral compass**: honest weights, fair contracts, real assets, shared risk, and a strict prohibition of **riba** (interest/usury). This chapter surveys money’s long arc—from barter to bullion to banknotes to today’s fiat—then shows how Islam corrected abuse and built trust.

## 2.1 Why Study Money?

Because money shapes **daily life**: wages, food prices, savings, charity, and public services. If money can be created at will by a few or chained to interest, it will quietly transfer wealth from the many to the few. Islam commands **justice** and **measure**:

> وَأَقِيمُوا الْوَزْنَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلَا تُخْسِرُوا الْمِيزَانَ (الرحمن 9)  
> *“Establish weight in justice and do not fall short in the balance.”* (Q 55:9)
>
> وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا اكْتَالُوا عَلَى النَّاسِ يَسْتَوْفُونَ وَإِذَا كَالُوهُمْ أَوْ وَّزَنُوهُمْ يُخْسِرُونَ (المطففين 1–3)  
> *“Woe to those who give less in measure—who, when they receive by measure from people, take in full; but when they measure or weigh for them, give less.”* (Q 83:1–3)

## 2.2 A Quick Timeline (5,000 Years)

- **Barter → Commodity Money:** Early markets swapped goods; then widely valued commodities (salt, grain, beads, livestock) became money.  
- **Metals (Copper, Silver, Gold):** Durable, divisible, and portable. Ancient Lydia minted coins (~7th c. BCE); weights/assays built trust.  
- **Islamic Era (7th–10th c. CE):** With Islam’s spread, **ethics** and **law** standardized trade across continents. Contracts (murābaḥah, muḍārabah), trust networks, and **sound coinage** supported huge caravans and maritime routes.  
- **Bills of Exchange & Paper:** Merchants used promissory notes and **sakk** (cheques). Later, state paper claims to metal emerged.  
- **Banking & Central Banking:** Receipts for deposited gold/silver circulated as money; over-issuance led to panics. Central banks arose to backstop banks—often socializing losses.  
- **Fiat Era (1971→):** The US ended dollar–gold convertibility; fiat currencies float. Now money is ledger entries created largely via **interest-bearing debt**.

## 2.3 Arabia Before Islam → Caravans and Markets

Pre-Islamic Arabia had seasonal markets (e.g., ʿUkāẓ), trade caravans between Yemen–Shām, and exposure to Byzantine and Sasanian coins. Economic life was vibrant but **uneven**: cheating in measure, usurious debt, and predatory contracts existed. Islam confronted this with **honesty**, **mercy**, and **law**—preserving enterprise while removing exploitation.

## 2.4 The Prophet ﷺ as a Trader

The Prophet ﷺ worked as a merchant, **sincere and trustworthy** (al-Ṣādiq al-Amīn). He partnered with **Khadīja** (رضي الله عنها), honoring contracts and sharing profits fairly. He taught that trade must be free of fraud, deception, and riba. **Trust**—truthful disclosure, timely payment, fulfillment—was the currency that multiplied business and brought **barakah** (blessing).

## 2.5 Contracts Islam Encouraged

- **Muḍārabah** — investor provides capital, entrepreneur provides effort; profits shared by ratio; **losses** borne by capital unless negligence.  
- **Mushārakah** — equity partnership; profits by agreement, losses by capital share.  
- **Murābaḥah** — cost-plus sale of a real, owned asset (not a disguised loan).  
- **Salam & Istisnāʿ** — pre-paid/agreed manufacture for real needs, with clarity and delivery terms.  
- **Ijārah** — leasing use-rights, not selling forbidden uncertainty.

These reflect Islam’s rule: **no guaranteed return without bearing risk** and **no money-from-money** without real trade or assets.

## 2.6 Islamic Coinage and Global Finance

Under **ʿAbd al-Malik** (Umayyad), the first **purely Islamic dinars/dirhams** were minted: Qur’anic inscriptions, no portraits, stable weights. Bimetallic standards (gold dinar, silver dirham) created reliable pricing across regions and centuries. Muslim merchants stitched together trade from **al-Andalus to China**, using fair contracts and credible coinage.

> وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا (البقرة 275)  
> *“Allah has permitted trade and forbidden riba.”* (Q 2:275)

## 2.7 Riba in Exchange — Why “Intrinsic Value” Matters

The Prophet ﷺ defined exchange of **ribawi** items:

> «الذَّهَبُ بِالذَّهَبِ، وَالْفِضَّةُ بِالْفِضَّةِ، وَالْبُرُّ بِالْبُرِّ، وَالشَّعِيرُ بِالشَّعِيرِ، وَالتَّمْرُ بِالتَّمْرِ، وَالْمِلْحُ بِالْمِلْحِ، مِثْلًا بِمِثْلٍ، يَدًا بِيَدٍ؛ فَإِذَا اخْتَلَفَتْ هَذِهِ الأَصْنَافُ فَبِيعُوا كَيْفَ شِئْتُمْ إِذَا كَانَ يَدًا بِيَدٍ» (مسلم)  
> *“Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, and salt for salt—like for like, equal for equal, hand to hand; if the kinds differ, sell as you wish, so long as it is hand to hand.”* (Muslim)

**Bilāl’s dates** example shows **riba al-faḍl**: unequal swap of the same kind on the spot is forbidden. The principle protects markets from **hidden exploitation**. From this, scholars derived that **money**—being a standard of value—should not become a tool to **extract value without risk**. Our project’s thesis (to be debated respectfully) is that **fiat**—created at will and lent at interest—facilitates systemic riba and **hidden taxation via inflation**, whereas **asset-backed** or intrinsically valuable money better aligns with Islamic aims.

> وَمَا آتَيْتُم مِّن رِّبًا لِّيَرْبُوَا فِي أَمْوَالِ النَّاسِ فَلَا يَرْبُوا عِندَ اللَّهِ (الروم 39)  
> *“What you give in riba to increase within the wealth of people does not increase with Allah.”* (Q 30:39)

## 2.8 Supremacist Empires, Colonial Currency, and Modern Apartheid-Like Controls

History shows that **supremacist ideologies** weaponize money. Empires imposed currency boards and debt to control colonies. In the 20th century, **Nazism** dehumanized minorities and plundered economies. In recent times, **Zionism as a political project** has produced policies—**dispossession, settlement expansion, and collective punishment**—that crush Palestinian economic life. Checkpoints, blockades, and permit regimes function like **financial throttles**: they fragment markets, destroy family wealth, and trap youth in unemployment. Islam condemns such oppression and calls us to defend the weak, speak truth, and build **halal alternatives**.

>… مَن قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعًا (المائدة 32)  
> *“…whoever kills a soul—unless [in retribution] or for (grave) corruption in the land—it is as if he had slain all mankind.”* (Q 5:32)
>
> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ (المائدة 8)  
> *“O you who believe! Be steadfast for Allah, witnesses in justice.”* (Q 5:8)

## 2.9 Lessons for Today

- **Sound money** (gold/silver or strong asset-backing) restrains arbitrary creation, aligns with **real economy**, and discourages riba.  
- **Contracts** must link financing to **real assets/work**, not to compounding debt.  
- **Justice** in policy: end structures that strip wealth from the vulnerable by design.  
- **Build** halal rails—transparent, asset-backed instruments; ethical fintech; community funds.

This is the road toward our **Umicom Asset-Backed Security Coin**: a Shariah-aligned unit of account and exchange anchored to verified, audited assets—constructed to **serve people**, not exploit them.

## Supplication (Duʿāʾ)

**Arabic:**  
اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ لَنَا فِي رِزْقِنَا، وَاجْعَلْ مَالَنَا قُوَّةً لِلطَّاعَةِ، وَحِصْنًا مِنَ الظُّلْمِ، وَنَجِّنَا مِنَ الرِّبَا وَمِنْ نُظُمِ الظُّلْمِ، وَارْزُقْنَا صِدْقًا فِي الْبَيْعِ وَالشِّرَاءِ وَالْعُقُودِ.

**English:**  
*O Allah, bless our provision; make our wealth a strength for obedience and a shield against injustice; save us from riba and oppressive systems; and grant us truthfulness in buying, selling, and contracts.*

## Chapter Summary (Refresher)

- Money’s form changed across millennia, but Islam’s **ethic** stayed constant: honest measure, fair exchange, no riba.  
- The Prophet ﷺ modeled trustworthy trade; Islamic contracts align **profit with risk** and **finance with real assets**.  
- **Ribawi rules** (gold/silver, like-for-like, hand-to-hand) protect markets from exploitation.  
- **Fiat + interest** tends to centralize power and silently tax the poor; **asset-backed** money better serves justice.  
- Supremacist projects—from Nazism to modern apartheid-like policies—weaponize money; Islam commands we **stand for justice** and **build alternatives**.
