## 4.1 How banks create money
When a bank issues a loan, it **credits** the borrower’s account with new deposits — money created from nothing — then demands repayment **plus interest**.

## 4.2 Central banks and governments
Governments sell bonds; central banks buy them with newly created reserves. Taxpayers carry the **interest burden**.

> **“Allah destroys riba and gives increase for charities.”**  
> **يَمْحَقُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّبَا وَيُرْبِى ٱلصَّدَقَـٰتِ** *(Al‑Baqarah 2:276)*

## 4.3 Why it collapses
Debt must grow to service past interest. Eventually, defaults rise; the state prints more money → inflation. The cycle repeats.

## 4.4 Real‑world impacts (case snapshots)
- **Student debt (US)** — lifelong repayments for millions.
- **IMF programs** — currency devaluation and austerity.
- **Egypt** — repeated devaluations crush wages and savings.
- **Gaza** — transfers blocked; fees consume aid.

> **“A time will come when everyone will consume riba; if he does not consume it, its dust will reach him.”** *(Abū Dāwūd 3331)*

## 4.5 Islam’s alternative at a glance
- **Mudarabah/Musharakah** — risk‑sharing, not risk‑shifting.
- **Ijarah** — fair leasing.
- **Zakat/Waqf** — social safety and productive endowments.

### Supplication
**اللَّهُمَّ عَلِّمْنَا مَا يَنْفَعُنَا، وَانْفَعْنَا بِمَا عَلَّمْتَنَا، وَارْزُقْنَا مَالًا حَلَالًا طَيِّبًا.**  
*O Allah, teach us what benefits us, benefit us through what You have taught us, and grant us pure halal wealth.*
