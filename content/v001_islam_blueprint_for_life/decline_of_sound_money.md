# Chapter 3 — The Decline of Sound Money

## 3.1 Colonialism and currency control
European empires conquered lands and **replaced intrinsic money** with currencies tied to their banks. Debt and taxation in foreign money created dependence.

## 3.2 From receipts to fiat
Paper began as a **claim on gold/silver**. Over time, issuers printed more notes than reserves → **fiat** (value by decree).

## 3.3 Bretton Woods (1944) → 1971
The dollar was pegged to gold at $35/oz; the world pegged to the dollar. In **1971**, the dollar left gold entirely. From then on: unlimited printing and chronic inflation.

> **“Woe to those who give less than due…”** *(Al‑Muṭaffifīn 83:1–3)* — inflation quietly reduces people’s purchasing power.

## 3.4 Riba and the debt engine
Loans are created with **interest**; money to pay the interest does not exist unless new debt is issued. Nations and families become permanent debtors.

> **“…If you do not desist, then be informed of a war from Allah and His Messenger.”**
> **فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُوا فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ** *(Al‑Baqarah 2:279)*

## 3.5 The 2008 lesson
Risky mortgages were bundled and sold as safe. When borrowers defaulted, the system crashed. Banks were rescued by money printing; ordinary people were not.

## 3.6 Why this matters
- Inflation is **hidden theft** from savers and workers.
- Riba concentrates wealth with lenders.
- Sound money and just contracts are **moral necessities**, not nostalgia.

### Supplication
### اللَّهُمَّ نَجِّنَا مِنْ ظُلْمِ الرِّبَا، وَاهْدِنَا لِبِنَاءِ نِظَامٍ عَادِلٍ قَائِمٍ عَلَى شَرِيعَتِكَ.
### O Allah, save us from the oppression of riba and guide us to build a just system based on Your Sharīʿah.
