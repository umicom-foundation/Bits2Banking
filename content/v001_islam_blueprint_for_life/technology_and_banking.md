# Chapter 5 — Technology and Banking

## 5.1 Bits to value
Computers store and move **bits (0/1)**. Your bank balance is a number in a **database**.

## 5.2 Banking tech stack (simplified)
- **Core banking systems** — accounts, payments, loans.
- **Treasury/Capital Markets** — platforms like Calypso/Murex for trading & risk.
- **Databases** — Oracle/SQL store transactions.
- **Messaging** — SWIFT/FIX/FpML move instructions between banks.

## 5.3 Milestones
- **Sakk** (cheques) and **hawāla** — Islamic Golden Age.  
- **Double‑entry** — merchant accounting revolution.  
- **Telegraph** → early electronic transfers.  
- **SWIFT (1973)**, **ATMs (1967)**, **online/mobile banking**.  
- **Blockchain (2009–)** — distributed ledgers (powerful but often speculative when unbacked).

## 5.4 Why Islam matters here
Tech is a tool. Without Sharīʿah principles (no riba/gharar/maysir; real assets; transparency), technology can **amplify injustice**.

### Supplication
**اللَّهُمَّ وَفِّقْنَا لِتَسْخِيرِ التِّقْنِيَةِ فِي الْخَيْرِ وَالْعَدْلِ.**  
*O Allah, enable us to harness technology for good and justice.*
