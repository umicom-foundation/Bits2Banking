# Chapter 7 — Umicom ABS Coin (Asset‑Backed, Sharīʿah‑Compliant)

## 7.1 The need
- Fiat inflates away savings.  
- Unbacked crypto is speculative.  
- Many “Islamic” products mimic interest finance.

## 7.2 What Umicom is
A **digital coin backed by real assets** (gold, silver, food, energy, commodities), recorded on a transparent ledger with redeemability.

**Sharīʿah fit:** no riba, no gharar (clear assets/terms), no maysir (value from assets, not chance).

## 7.3 How it works (simple flow)
1) **Assets deposited** → coins minted.  
2) **Circulation** → trade, remittances, aid, SME finance.  
3) **Redemption** → coin returned for underlying assets.

## 7.4 Who benefits
- **Families** — savings that keep purchasing power.  
- **Businesses** — stable unit of account for trade.  
- **Communities in crisis** — direct, low‑fee aid.  
- **Nations** — issue value tied to real output.

## 7.5 Case sketches
- **Gaza** — aid without 50% transfer losses.  
- **Egypt** — inflation‑resistant savings.  
- **Africa** — tokenise resources; avoid dollar debt.  
- **Remittances** — instant, near‑zero‑cost.

> **“And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance.”** *(Ar‑Raḥmān 55:9)*

### Supplication
**اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ فِي مَشْرُوعِ Umicom، وَاجْعَلْهُ سَبِيلًا لِلْعَدْلِ وَالْمَنْفَعَةِ لِلنَّاسِ.**  
*O Allah, bless the Umicom project and make it a path to justice and benefit for people.*
