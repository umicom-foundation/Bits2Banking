# 0008 — Hall of Shame: Collaboration, Corruption, and Betrayal

This chapter documents **patterns** of collaboration with oppressors and **historical cases** backed by public records. The aim is reform, not rage.

> **Q 4:135:** Stand firm for justice, witnesses for Allah—even against yourselves.  
> **Q 2:188:** Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly or use it to bribe rulers.

## Why leaders sell out

- **Private gain:** money, property, immunity, titles.  
- **Foreign leverage:** threats/sanctions or promises of support.  
- **Weak institutions:** no audits, no free press, no independent courts.  
- **Decayed ethics:** riba-soaked economies that reward extraction.

## Documented historical examples (illustrative)

- **Benedict Arnold** (1780): plotted to surrender West Point for money and rank.  
- **Vidkun Quisling** (1940–45): Nazi collaborator in Norway.  
- **Philippe Pétain** (Vichy France): collaborationist regime, convicted post-war.  
- **Wang Jingwei** (WWII China): Japanese-backed government in Nanjing.  
- **Andrey Vlasov** (WWII): led Russian Liberation Army with the Nazis.  
- **Mīr Jaʿfar** (1757): defected at Plassey; opened Bengal to Company control.  
- **Ephialtes** (480 BCE): betrayed the pass at Thermopylae for reward.  
- **Sale of Joan of Arc** (1430): captured then ransomed to enemies.

## Islamic framing

- **Rule by revelation, not bribery.**  
- **Strong contracts and public ledgers.**  
- **Shūrā (consultation)** and independent judiciary.  
- **Zakat/waqf** as social floors that weaken “sell-out” incentives.

## Summary

Betrayal recurs across civilizations. Only **systems**—ethical finance, transparent governance, real accountability—cure the disease.

## Duʿāʾ

اللَّهُمَّ احْفَظْ أُمَّتَنَا مِنْ خَوَانَةِ الْأَمَانَةِ، وَارْزُقْنَا قَادَةً عَادِلِينَ، وَانْصُرِ الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي كُلِّ مَكَانٍ.  
O Allah, protect our community from betrayal, grant us just leaders, and aid the oppressed everywhere.
