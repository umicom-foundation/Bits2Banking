# Bits to Banking — What You Will Learn

This volume is a hands-on pathway from **computing fundamentals** (bits, binary, operating systems) to **software development**, **databases**, **networking & security**, and finally **finance systems** and **Treasury/Trading** concepts used in the real world.

---

## Who this is for

- Beginners who want a clear, practical route from zero to building useful things.  
- Engineers from other fields who want a **finance-tech** overview.  
- Contributors who can add examples, diagrams, labs, or case studies.

---

## Learning outcomes

By the end you will be able to:

- Explain how data becomes meaning: **bits → bytes → files → processes**.  
- Use the command line and write small programs to automate tasks.  
- Model and query data in **relational databases**.  
- Understand core **networking** and **security** ideas.  
- Read and discuss **banking/treasury** workflows with the right vocabulary.

## Suggested outline

- **ch01 — Bits & Binary:** Representation, integers, text, endianness.  
- **ch02 — Operating Systems primer:** Processes, memory, filesystems, permissions.  
- **ch03 — Programming basics:** Variables, control flow, functions, modules, tests.  
- **ch04 — Data modeling & SQL:** Tables, keys, normalization, joins, transactions.  
- **ch05 — Networking:** TCP/IP, HTTP, tools, client–server mini-labs.  
- **ch06 — Security essentials:** Hashing, crypto at a high level, auth, threat basics.  
- **ch07 — Finance foundations:** Money flows, accounts, ledgers, payments rails.  
- **ch08 — Market data & pricing:** Instruments, quotes, risk-at-a-glance.  
- **ch09 — Treasury systems overview:** Positions, cash, risk, settlement; where **Calypso/TMS** fits.  
- **ch10 — Mini projects:** ETL a CSV into a DB; simple pricing/reporting script; mock “ops” day.

This outline will evolve with contributions and reviewer feedback.

## Contributing to this volume

1. Create or use the folder:
   ```text
   raw_docs/bits-to-banking/
   ```
2. Add chapters as **.md**, **.docx**, or **.pdf**.  
   - Optional cover image: `bookcover_Bits_to_Banking.png`  
3. Commit to **main** (or open a PR). The **Ingest** bot will:
   - Convert/copy to `content/volumes/bits-to-banking/`
   - Auto-number new chapters (`ch01-...`)
   - Normalize Markdown (front-matter, title, code fences)

If your file is very large (PDF > 40MB, DOCX > 20MB, MD > 2MB), it will be **skipped** with a warning in the Action logs.

---

## Getting hands-on (starter tasks)

- Reproduce a binary-to-decimal conversion with a short script.  
- Write a CLI that reads a CSV and prints summary stats.  
- Spin up a local database and run three non-trivial joins.  
- Use a packet capture tool to observe a simple HTTP request.  
- Sketch a money movement from account A → B and identify risks.

We’ll refine these into end-to-end labs as the volume grows.

## Next steps

Pick a chapter (e.g., **Bits & Binary**) and start drafting under `raw_docs/bits-to-banking/`.  
Include small, runnable examples and short exercises.
