# Chapter 2 — The History of Money and Trade in Islam

## 2.1 Why study money?
Money is a social agreement. When it is honest, society flourishes; when it is corrupted, the weak are exploited. Islam came to protect people from injustice in measures, weights, and contracts.

> **“And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance.”**  
> **وَأَقِيمُوا الْوَزْنَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلَا تُخْسِرُوا الْمِيزَانَ** *(Ar-Raḥmān 55:9)*

> **“Woe to those who give less than due…”**  
> **وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ** *(Al-Muṭaffifīn 83:1–3)*

## 2.2 A quick timeline (5,000 years)
- **Barter** → swapping goods directly (grain for wool). Works locally but breaks down across distance/time.
- **Commodity money** → widely desired goods (salt, grain, copper) used as media of exchange.
- **Coinage** → standard weights of metal (electrum, gold, silver) in Lydia (c. 600 BCE), then Persia, Greece, Rome.
- **Debasement** → rulers dilute coins to fund wars → inflation and social unrest.
- **Islamic reform (7th century CE)** → justice in trade, fair weights, and prohibition of riba.
- **Paper claims** → receipts for stored metal evolve into drafts, cheques, and bills of exchange.
- **Modern fiat** → paper (and now digital) money without intrinsic backing; value depends on trust in the issuer.

## 2.3 Arabia before Islam → caravans and markets
Makkah sat on the Red Sea–Levant trade route. Quraysh caravans traveled **north in summer** and **south in winter**. Security and trust powered commerce.

> **“For the accustomed security of Quraysh—their security in the caravan journey of winter and summer—let them worship the Lord of this House, who fed them against hunger and secured them from fear.”**  
> **لِإِيلَافِ قُرَيْشٍ …** *(Sūrat Quraysh 106:1–4)*

## 2.4 The Prophet ﷺ as a trader
Before prophethood, Muḥammad ﷺ traded ethically on behalf of **Khadījah (RA)** and earned the title **al-Amīn (the Trustworthy)**. Islam made honesty the core of markets.

The Prophet ﷺ said:  
> **“The truthful, trustworthy merchant will be with the Prophets, the truthful, and the martyrs.”**  
> **التَّاجِرُ الصَّدُوقُ الأَمِينُ مَعَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ** *(Tirmidhī 1209)*

## 2.5 Contracts Islam encouraged
- **Mudarabah** — investor provides capital, entrepreneur provides effort; profits shared, loss borne by capital.
- **Musharakah** — partnership where all share capital and risk.
- **Salam** — full advance payment for specified future delivery (e.g., crops).
- **Ijarah** — lease/rent with responsibilities defined.
- **Sakk (cheque)** and **hawāla** — safe long-distance payments built on trust.

These spread from the Muslim world to Europe and helped create global trade.

## 2.6 Islamic coinage and global finance
- **Umayyad** caliph ʿAbd al-Malik minted the **first purely Islamic dinars/dirhams** (Qur’anic inscriptions; no portraits).
- **Abbasid** Baghdad became a financial hub. Merchants used **sakk** (cheques) across cities and **hawāla** for remittances.
- **Ottomans** maintained silver **akçe** then **gold lira**; later debt and European pressure pushed debasement and decline.

Classical scholars condemned tampering with money. Imām al-Ghazālī likened debasement to **stealing from the poor**.

## 2.7 A note on riba in exchange
When exchanging the **same** commodity (e.g., dates for dates, gold for gold), Islam requires **equal weight and spot delivery** to prevent exploitation.  
The famous **Bilāl (RA) dates** report shows how quality-for-quantity swaps can hide interest.

> The Prophet ﷺ said about exchanging inferior for superior dates directly: **“This is riba itself… Sell the inferior for money, then buy the better dates.”** *(Bukhārī 2312; Muslim 1592)*

This principle later informs our critique of **fiat** and **unbacked crypto**.

## 2.8 Lessons for today
- **Sound money** (gold/silver/real assets) protects society from hidden theft.
- **Trust + contracts** power markets better than brute force.
- **Cheating in measures** (including by currency manipulation) destroys blessing.

### Reflection (18+)
Compare two systems: Rome’s debasement → collapse, versus Islam’s insistence on fair weights → flourishing trade. Which resembles today’s world more?

### Supplication (Duʿā’)
**اللَّهُمَّ ارْزُقْنَا الصِّدْقَ فِي بُيُوعِنَا وَعُقُودِنَا، وَبَارِكْ لَنَا فِي رِزْقِنَا، وَأَجِرْنَا مِنْ ظُلْمِ الرِّبَا وَالْغِشِّ.**  
*O Allah, grant us truthfulness in our sales and contracts, bless our provision, and protect us from the oppression of riba and cheating.*
