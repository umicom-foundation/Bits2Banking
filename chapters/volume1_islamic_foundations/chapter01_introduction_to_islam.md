# Chapter 1 — An Easy Introduction to Islam

> **Bismillah (In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate)**

## Life with a Purpose
Muslims believe life isn’t random. Allah (God), Creator of everything, sent guidance so we can live well and succeed in this world and the next. That guidance is the **Qur’an** and the teachings of the prophets.

Allah created the heavens and the earth, then created **Adam** and his companion **Hawwa’ (Eve)**. They were given simple instructions in Paradise, and a mission to **inhabit the earth** and act as **caretakers**.

> **“And [mention] when your Lord said to the angels, ‘Indeed, I will place upon the earth a successive authority (khalīfah).’”**  
> **وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً**  
> *(Al-Baqarah 2:30)*

## Prophets as Reminders of Purpose
Human beings forget. We chase short-term pleasures and lose sight of why we’re here. Allah sent messengers to recalibrate us.

> **“And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], ‘Worship Allah and avoid false gods.’”**  
> **وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ**  
> *(An-Naḥl 16:36)*

> **“And I did not create jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”**  
> **وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ**  
> *(Adh-Dhāriyāt 51:56)*

Here, *worship* (ʿibādah) means more than rituals: it includes **serving Allah’s cause** by being beneficial, just, and compassionate.

## Islam Means Submission — For Our Benefit
**Islam** means **submission** to Allah. Submitting to the wise rules of the Creator leads to human flourishing—personally and socially—even when a rule first feels “restrictive.”

Think of traffic lights: they “restrict,” yet they **save lives** and keep everyone moving.

## One Human Family — No Superior Race
All people are **children of Adam and Hawwa’**. Islam rejects racism and claims of a “chosen race.”

> **“O mankind, indeed We created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.”**  
> **يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ**  
> *(Al-Ḥujurāt 49:13)*

## No Compulsion in Way of Life
Faith must be chosen freely.

> **“There is no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clearly from falsehood.”**  
> **لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ**  
> *(Al-Baqarah 2:256)*

People are accountable to Allah; our role is to convey truth with wisdom and mercy.

## Belief in All Prophets, Scriptures, and the Unseen
Muslims believe in **all** prophets: Adam, Nūḥ (Noah), Ibrāhīm (Abraham), Mūsā (Moses), ʿĪsā (Jesus), and **Muḥammad** ﷺ (the final messenger) — among many others like Shīth and Idrīs (peace be upon them). We believe in **angels** and **jinn**, and in all scriptures revealed by Allah.

> **“Say, ‘We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit.’”**  
> **قُولُوا آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ… لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ**  
> *(Al-Baqarah 2:136)*

## Islam: Not Only 3% Worship — Also 97% Dealings
Rituals (prayer, fasting, pilgrimage) are the **foundation**. But Islam is also about **how we deal with people, animals, nature, trade, family, politics, and justice**.

> **“Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly, but only [in lawful] trade by mutual consent.”**  
> **وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَنْ تَرَاضٍ**  
> *(An-Nisā’ 4:29)*

> **“Woe to those who give less [than due]… who, when they measure for themselves, take in full; but when they measure or weigh for others, they cause loss.”**  
> **وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ…**  
> *(Al-Muṭaffifīn 83:1–3)*

The Prophet ﷺ said:  
> **“Whoever cheats us is not one of us.”**  
> **مَنْ غَشَّنَا فَلَيْسَ مِنَّا**  
> *(Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 102)*

### Riba (Interest) Is Forbidden
> **“…If you do not desist, then be informed of a war from Allah and His Messenger.”**  
> **فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُوا فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ**  
> *(Al-Baqarah 2:279)*

**Bilāl’s dates** story: He swapped two baskets of inferior dates for one of superior. The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **“Oh! This is riba itself… Sell the inferior dates for money, then buy the better dates.”**  
> *(Bukhārī 2312; Muslim 1592)*

### Money Needs Intrinsic Value
Historically, Muslims used the **gold dinar** and **silver dirham** — assets with real value. **Fiat money** and **unbacked crypto** can be inflated or manipulated, echoing Qur’anic warnings against cheating in measures.

> **“And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance.”**  
> **وَأَقِيمُوا الْوَزْنَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلَا تُخْسِرُوا الْمِيزَانَ**  
> *(Ar-Raḥmān 55:9)*

## Embrace Islam Holistically
Don’t pick and choose.

> **“O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely (kāffah).”**  
> **يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ادْخُلُوا فِي السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً**  
> *(Al-Baqarah 2:208)*

Leaders are warned:

> **“Whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed — they are the disbelievers / wrongdoers / rebellious.”**  
> *(Al-Mā’idah 5:44–47)*

## Giving and Serving
> **“The upper hand is better than the lower hand.”** *(Bukhārī 1427; Muslim 1033)*  
> **“The most beloved people to Allah are those most beneficial to people.”** *(Musnad Aḥmad 23408)*

Service to many leads to greatness.

## Responsibility Beyond Humans
A woman was punished for mistreating a **cat**: she neither fed it nor let it go free. *(Bukhārī 3318; Muslim 2242)*  
Islam includes mercy to **animals** and care for the **environment**.

## Towards “Bits to Banking” & Umicom
This book, **Bits to Banking**, will guide readers from **technology** to **finance** to **Islamic economics**, culminating in **Umicom — an asset-backed, Sharīʿah-compliant digital coin** designed to protect value and enable fair trade.

> **“And We have not sent you [O Muḥammad] except as a mercy to the worlds.”**  
> **وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ**  
> *(Al-Anbiyā’ 21:107)*

## Supplication (Duʿā’)
**اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِكَ الصَّالِحِينَ، الَّذِينَ يَعْبُدُونَكَ حَقَّ العِبَادَةِ، وَيَخْدِمُونَ خَلْقَكَ بِالْعِلْمِ وَالْعَدْلِ وَالرَّحْمَةِ.**  
*O Allah, make us among Your righteous servants who worship You truly and serve Your creation with knowledge, justice, and mercy.*
