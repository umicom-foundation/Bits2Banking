## Contribute in 3 minutes

1. **Pick a volume slug** (lowercase, hyphens): e.g., `volume-0`, `introduction-to-islam`, `bits-to-banking`  
2. **Upload your file(s)** into `raw_docs/&lt;slug&gt;/` as **`.md`**, **`.docx`**, or **`.pdf`**.  
   - Optional cover image: **`bookcover_&lt;book_title&gt;.png`** (or `.jpg`)  
3. **Commit to `main`** (or open a PR).  
4. Bot converts/copies into `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/` and auto-numbers new chapters: `ch01-…`, `ch02-…`

### Examples
```text
raw_docs/volume-0/intro.md
raw_docs/introduction-to-islam/history.docx
raw_docs/bits-to-banking/bookcover_Bits_to_Banking.png
```text

---

## What the bot does (exactly)

1. **Markdown passthrough**  
   Copies `.md` to `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/` (and lists them for auto-numbering).
2. **DOCX → Markdown**  
   Uses Pandoc to produce GitHub-Flavored Markdown; extracts embedded images to `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/images/&lt;basename&gt;/`.
3. **PDF → DOCX → Markdown (best-effort)**  
   Converts text-based PDFs via LibreOffice → DOCX → Markdown. Scanned/image-only PDFs become images and may need manual edits.
4. **Book cover standardization**  
   Files named `bookcover_&lt;book_title&gt;.(png|jpg|jpeg)` are saved as `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/images/cover.png`.
5. **Auto-numbering (new files only)**  
   Fresh files from this run are renamed to `chNN-&lt;slug&gt;.md` to keep chapters ordered. Existing files are not renamed.
6. **Normalization**  
   Adds YAML front-matter if missing (title, volume, status, dates), ensures a top-level `# Title`, and fixes bare code fences to `text`.

### Guards &amp; hygiene
- Skips junk/temp files (e.g., `~$docx`, `.tmp`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`).
- Warns (does not fail) on uppercase or spaces in filenames—use **lowercase-hyphenated** names.
- Skips very large files with a **warning** (Markdown &gt;2MB, DOCX &gt;20MB, PDF &gt;40MB, images &gt;10MB).

---

## File conventions (quick rules)

- **Filenames:** `lowercase-hyphenated.md` (e.g., `risk-management.md`)  
- **One H1 per chapter:**  
  ```markdown
  # My Chapter Title</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code fences</strong> specify a language:

Introduction to Islam A Complete Way of Life</h2>
<h1 id="introduction-to-islam--a-complete-way-of-life">Introduction to
Islam — A Complete Way of Life</h1>
<p>Islam begins with a clear truth: <strong>Allah is One</strong>, the
Creator of the heavens and the earth, and He created humanity with
purpose, wisdom, and dignity. In the Qur’an, Allah tells us He placed
humankind on earth as <strong>khalīfah</strong>—stewards who cultivate
goodness, restrain harm, and build just communities. Islam is therefore
<strong>A Complete Way of Life (DEEN)</strong>: not only private
worship, but belief, prayer, character, family, markets and contracts,
governance, mercy to people and to every living thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2:30 (Arabic):</strong> وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي
الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً <strong>Meaning:</strong> “When your Lord said to the
angels, ‘I am placing upon the earth a khalīfah (successive
authority).’”</p>
<p><strong>Q 51:56 (Arabic):</strong> وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “I did not create jinn and humans except that
they worship (serve) Me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To “worship” Allah is more than prayer and fasting. It means
<strong>serving Allah’s cause</strong> with truthfulness in everyday
life: keeping promises, honoring contracts, protecting life and dignity,
feeding the poor, preserving the environment, and refusing corruption.
Islam shapes a person whose <strong>heart is with Allah</strong> and
whose <strong>hands serve people</strong>. Lived individually and
collectively, Islam brings balance, justice, and barakah.</p>
<h2 id="submission-entirely-not-selectively">Submission: Entirely, Not
Selectively</h2>
<p>“Islam” literally means <strong>submission</strong>. Submitting to
Allah’s guidance is not a loss of freedom; it is aligning with the way
the Designer designed life to work best. The Qur’an warns against
<strong>picking a few rules we like and discarding the rest</strong>;
that breeds hypocrisy and injustice. Entering Islam
<strong>holistically</strong> brings harmony.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2:208 (Arabic):</strong> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ادْخُلُوا فِي
السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً <strong>Meaning:</strong> “O you who believe! Enter into
Islam <strong>completely</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example — selective ethics fails:</strong> a leader who prays
but lies in contracts poisons trust; a trader who gives charity but
manipulates weights harms the poor. Islam closes these loopholes by
joining <strong>ʿaqīdah</strong> (belief), <strong>ʿibādah</strong>
(worship), and <strong>muʿāmalāt</strong> (dealings) into one moral
whole.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-pillars--a-daily-system-of-growth">The Five Pillars — A
Daily System of Growth</h2>
<p>The <strong>Five Pillars</strong> are the <strong>engine of
transformation</strong>. Together they train <strong>time management,
commitment, sacrifice, community responsibility, and constant
remembrance</strong>. They interlock like ribs of an arch: remove one
and the structure weakens; practice them together and life
straightens.</p>
<h3 id="1-shahādah--the-foundation-of-meaning">1) Shahādah — The
Foundation of Meaning</h3>
<p>The testimony “Lā ilāha illā Allāh, Muḥammad rasūl Allāh” orients
everything: <strong>no rivals to Allah</strong> in fear, hope, love,
obedience, law, and loyalty. It resets identity away from ego, tribe,
race, or ideology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 47:19 (Arabic):</strong> فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ
لِذَنبِكَ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Know that there is no deity except
Allah, and seek forgiveness for your sin.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interconnection:</strong> The shahādah feeds
<strong>ṣalāh</strong> with sincerity, <strong>zakāh</strong> with
purpose, <strong>ṣawm</strong> with patience, and <strong>ḥajj</strong>
with devotion. It’s the compass.</p>
<h3 id="2-ṣalāh-prayer--time-management-and-presence">2) Ṣalāh (Prayer)
— Time Management and Presence</h3>
<p>Five daily prayers carve the day into <strong>sacred
appointments</strong> with Allah, training punctuality, focus, and
humility. Each call to prayer reminds the soul that <strong>Allāhu Akbar
(Allah is greater)</strong>—greater than deadlines, profits, anxieties,
and screens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 20:14 (Arabic):</strong> إِنَّنِيٓ أَنَا ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّآ أَنَا
فَٱعْبُدْنِي وَأَقِمِ ٱلصَّلَاةَ لِذِكْرِي <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Indeed, I am Allah;
there is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My
remembrance.”</p>
<p><strong>Q 29:45 (Arabic):</strong> إِنَّ ٱلصَّلَاةَ تَنْهَىٰ عَنِ ٱلْفَحْشَاءِ وَٱلْمُنكَرِ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Indeed, prayer restrains from immorality and
wrongdoing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Allāhu Akbar — the daily reset:</strong> The phrase in the
adhān and prayer <strong>shrinks the ego</strong> and <strong>re-centers
priorities</strong>. For a few minutes each time, we detach from the
rushing world to realign with the <strong>real purpose</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="3-zakāh-purifying-alms--discipline-and-social-justice">3) Zakāh
(Purifying Alms) — Discipline and Social Justice</h3>
<p>Zakāh is a <strong>due</strong> on wealth for those eligible; it
<strong>purifies</strong> the giver and <strong>relieves</strong> the
vulnerable. Its annual cycle demands accounting, planning, and
responsibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 9:103 (Arabic):</strong> خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِمْ
بِهَا <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Take from their wealth charity by which
you purify and grow them.”</p>
<p><strong>Q 9:60 (Arabic):</strong> إِنَّمَا ٱلصَّدَقَاتُ لِلْفُقَرَاءِ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ...
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Charities are for the poor, the needy…”
(lists categories)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interconnection:</strong> Zakāh turns private piety into
<strong>public mercy</strong>; it complements prayer and prepares the
heart for <strong>sacrifice</strong> in fasting and
<strong>solidarity</strong> in ḥajj.</p>
<h3 id="4-ṣawm-fasting--patience-focus-and-freedom-from-addictions">4)
Ṣawm (Fasting) — Patience, Focus, and Freedom from Addictions</h3>
<p>Ramadān trains <strong>self-mastery</strong>: hunger without
complaint, restraint without resentment, generosity without show. It
resets body rhythms and compels <strong>time stewardship</strong>
(suḥūr, ifṭār, nightly Qur’ān).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2:183 (Arabic):</strong> يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ
ٱلصِّيَامُ... لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Fasting has been
prescribed for you… so that you may become God-conscious.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interconnection:</strong> Fasting strengthens prayer’s
presence, softens the heart for giving, and readies the pilgrim for
ḥajj’s hardships.</p>
<h3 id="5-ḥajj-pilgrimage--unity-planning-and-lifelong-renewal">5) Ḥajj
(Pilgrimage) — Unity, Planning, and Lifelong Renewal</h3>
<p>Ḥajj is a <strong>once-in-a-lifetime summit</strong> for those able.
It requires <strong>logistics, savings, patience</strong>, and
<strong>collective discipline</strong> as millions move in a common
rhythm, all in simple garments, all equal before Allah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 3:97 (Arabic):</strong> وَلِلَّهِ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ حِجُّ ٱلْبَيْتِ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَاعَ
إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Pilgrimage to the House is a duty
owed to Allah by people who are able to find a way.”</p>
<p><strong>Q 22:27 (Arabic):</strong> وَأَذِّنْ فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْحَجِّ يَأْتُوكَ رِجَالًا...
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Proclaim the pilgrimage to the people; they
will come to you on foot and on every lean camel…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interconnection:</strong> Ḥajj <strong>completes</strong>
what shahādah began, what ṣalāh and ṣawm trained, and what zakāh
funded—<strong>a life woven into community and submission</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How the Pillars teach rhythm and responsibility:</strong>
Daily (ṣalāh), yearly (zakāh, ṣawm), once-in-a-lifetime (ḥajj), and
constant (shahādah). They <strong>structure time</strong>,
<strong>prioritize values</strong>, and <strong>anchor the
heart</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="one-human-family--no-superior-race">One Human Family — No
Superior Race</h2>
<p>Islam teaches we all descend from <strong>Ādam and Ḥawwāʾ</strong>.
Humanity is one family. We differ in languages and cultures, but none of
this makes one group superior. Honor with Allah is by
<strong>taqwā</strong> (God-consciousness) and good deeds, not by blood,
color, passport, or tribe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 49:13 (Arabic):</strong> يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ
وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَتْقَىٰكُمْ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “O humankind! We created you from a male and a
female and made you peoples and tribes so that you may know one another.
Indeed, the most honored of you with Allah is the most
God-conscious.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet ﷺ declared in the Farewell Sermon that there is
<strong>no superiority</strong> of Arab over non-Arab, nor white over
black, except by taqwā. Supremacist ideologies—old or new—contradict
Allah’s justice and <strong>tear the human family apart</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 5:8 (Arabic):</strong> وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَىٰ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا
ۚ اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Do not let hatred of
a people lead you away from justice. Be just—that is nearer to
taqwā.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Historical snapshot — Copt and the governor’s son:</strong>
In Egypt, a Coptic man complained that a governor’s son struck him. The
case reached <strong>ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb</strong> (raḍiyallāhu ʿanhu).
The Caliph called them to Madinah; the Copt struck the offender back in
public, and ʿUmar rebuked the governor: “Since when do you enslave
people when their mothers bore them free?” Justice in Islam does not
bend to rank.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-of-choice--no-compulsion">Freedom of Choice — No
Compulsion</h2>
<p>Islam invites with proof and mercy. <strong>There is no
compulsion</strong> in accepting the way of life. Allah gave us reason
and will, and He holds each person accountable for their own
choices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2:256 (Arabic):</strong> لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “There is no compulsion in religion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Madinah Charter</strong> recognized the security of
Muslim and non-Muslim communities alike and bound them to common justice
and defense. Coercion corrupts faith; persuasion, example, and due
process nurture it.</p>
<h2 id="all-scriptures--one-message-islam-tawḥīd-and-justice">All
Scriptures — One Message: Islam (Tawḥīd and Justice)</h2>
<p>Islam teaches that Allah sent <strong>revelation</strong> and
<strong>messengers</strong> across ages to call people to
<strong>tawḥīd</strong> (oneness of God) and righteous living. The
<strong>Tawrāh (Torah)</strong> given to Mūsā (Moses), the <strong>Zabūr
(Psalms)</strong> to Dāwūd (David), the <strong>Injīl (Gospel)</strong>
to ʿĪsā (Jesus), the <strong>Suhuf</strong> of Ibrāhīm (Abraham) and
Mūsā, and finally the <strong>Qur’ān</strong> to Muḥammad
ﷺ—<strong>all</strong> summoned humanity to <strong>submit to Allah
(Islam)</strong>, avoid idolatry, uphold justice, and prepare for
accountability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 21:25 (Arabic):</strong> وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا
نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّآ أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “We sent
no messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no
deity but Me, so worship Me.’”</p>
<p><strong>Q 16:36 (Arabic):</strong> وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ
ٱعْبُدُوا ٱللَّهَ وَٱجْتَنِبُوا ٱلطَّاغُوتَ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “We certainly
sent into every nation a messenger: ‘Worship Allah and avoid false
gods.’”</p>
<p><strong>Q 42:13 (Arabic):</strong> شَرَعَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا وَصَّىٰ بِهِ نُوحًا…
وَٱلَّذِيٓ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ… <strong>Meaning:</strong> “He has ordained for you of
religion what He enjoined upon Noah and what We have revealed to
you…”</p>
<p><strong>Q 3:19 (Arabic):</strong> إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْإِسْلَامُ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Indeed, the religion with Allah is
Islam.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslims affirm the <strong>original</strong> revelations; the Qur’ān
also warns that some altered or concealed parts of prior scripture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2:75 (Arabic):</strong> قَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَـٰمَ ٱللَّهِ
ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “A group among them
would hear the words of Allah, then alter it after understanding
it.”</p>
<p><strong>Q 3:78 (Arabic):</strong> وَإِنَّ مِنْهُمْ لَفَرِيقًا يَلْوُونَ أَلْسِنَتَهُم
بِٱلْكِتَـٰبِ لِتَحْسَبُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Among them is a
group who distort their tongues with the Book so you think it is from
the Book.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By contrast, Allah promises the Qur’ān’s preservation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 15:9 (Arabic):</strong> إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا ٱلذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـٰفِظُونَ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Indeed, We sent down the Reminder, and indeed
We will guard it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Qur’ān <strong>confirms and safeguards</strong> truths that
remain in earlier scriptures, summons the People of the Book back to
<strong>tawḥīd</strong> and justice, and completes divine guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 5:48 (Arabic):</strong> وَأَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا
بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ وَمُهَيْمِنًا عَلَيْهِ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “We revealed
to you the Book in truth, confirming what came before it of the
Scripture and as a guardian over it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="prophets-scripture-and-the-unseen">Prophets, Scripture, and the
Unseen</h2>
<p>Across history, Allah sent messengers when generations drifted from
purpose. Muslims believe in <strong>all the prophets</strong>—Ādam, Nūḥ,
Ibrāhīm, Mūsā, ʿĪsā, and Muḥammad (عليهم السلام)—and in the revelation
they brought in its original purity. We also believe in the
<strong>angels</strong>, the <strong>jinn</strong>, the <strong>Last
Day</strong>, and the <strong>divine decree</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2:285 (Arabic):</strong> آمَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ
وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ… <strong>Meaning:</strong> “The Messenger has believed in what
was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers: all of
them have believed in Allah, His angels, His books, and His
messengers…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Qur’an also warns about those who <strong>throw revelation behind
their backs</strong> and follow devils into manipulation and
sorcery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2:102 (Arabic):</strong> وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا تَتْلُوا ٱلشَّيَاطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ
سُلَيْمَانَ… <strong>Meaning:</strong> “They followed what devils recited
during the reign of Solomon… Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils
disbelieved, teaching people magic…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any group that demands <strong>allegiance above Allah’s
command</strong>—or trades truth for secrecy and worldly power—must be
refused. A believer’s pledge is to <strong>Allah alone</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="signs-in-revelation-and-in-nature">Signs in Revelation and in
Nature</h2>
<p>The Qur’an calls us to <strong>think, observe, and reflect</strong>.
It is a book of guidance, not a lab manual, yet many verses point us to
the natural world in ways that harmonize with what science
discovers—encouraging <strong>humility</strong> and
<strong>research</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creation from a joined origin (Q 21:30):</strong> the
heavens and the earth were a unified entity before being parted.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arabic:</strong> أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَنَّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ كَانَتَا
رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Expansion and sustaining of the heavens (Q 51:47):</strong>
Allah’s power to extend and uphold.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arabic:</strong> وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْيدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Mountains as stabilizing “pegs” (Q 78:6–7):</strong> imagery
of anchoring and stability.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arabic:</strong> أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ الْأَرْضَ مِهَادًا ۝ وَالْجِبَالَ أَوْتَادًا</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Barriers between bodies of water (Q 25:53;
55:19–20):</strong> natural boundaries where mixing is constrained.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arabic:</strong> مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ يَلْتَقِيَانِ ۝ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخٌ لَّا
يَبْغِيَانِ</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Embryonic development in stages (Q 23:12–14):</strong>
vivid, stage-wise progression that resonates with embryology.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arabic (excerpt):</strong> ثُمَّ خَلَقْنَا النُّطْفَةَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقْنَا الْعَلَقَةَ
مُضْغَةً فَخَلَقْنَا الْمُضْغَةَ عِظَامًا فَكَسَوْنَا الْعِظَامَ لَحْمًا</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Life from water (Q 21:30):</strong> water’s centrality to
life—calling for stewardship and conservation.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arabic:</strong> وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَاءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Iron “sent down” (Q 57:25):</strong> bestowed with strength
and benefit—apt for its stellar origin and human use.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arabic:</strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا الْحَدِيدَ فِيهِ بَأْسٌ شَدِيدٌ</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>These are <strong>āyāt</strong>—signs that invite rational confidence
in the Creator and energize a life of learning and service.</p>
<h2 id="simple-clear-pointers-to-the-creator">Simple, Clear Pointers to
the Creator</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The phone in the street:</strong> If you found a smartphone
on a beach, with a glass screen, chipset, camera, and a tuned OS, would
you say “the waves made it”? The more <strong>ordered</strong> and
<strong>purposeful</strong> a thing is, the more it points to
<strong>mind</strong> and <strong>will</strong> behind it. The cosmos is
not less ordered than a phone.</li>
<li><strong>The house and the blueprint:</strong> No one walks into a
house and says, “bricks arranged themselves.” Walls align, beams bear
load, plumbing follows design. The world shows <strong>laws</strong>,
<strong>constants</strong>, <strong>coded life</strong>—signs of an
<strong>Author</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>You, the observer:</strong> You experience
<strong>consciousness</strong>, <strong>moral intuition</strong>, and
<strong>meaning</strong>. Matter alone does not explain duty and beauty;
<strong>fitrah</strong> (innate disposition) recognizes a higher moral
lawgiver.</li>
<li><strong>Beginning needs a beginner:</strong> What begins to exist
has a cause. The universe is not past-eternal; it began. A <strong>first
cause</strong>, uncaused, powerful and knowing, best fits
<strong>Allah</strong>, the Necessary Being.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 52:35–36 (Arabic):</strong> أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ
الْخَالِقُونَ ۝ أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Were they
created from nothing, or are they creators? Or did they create the
heavens and the earth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="jihād--the-struggle-to-uplift-and-defend">Jihād — The Struggle
to Uplift and Defend</h2>
<p>“Jihād” means <strong>striving/struggle</strong>. Its broadest sense
is to exert oneself for Allah—<strong>to learn and teach</strong>,
<strong>to reform the self</strong>, <strong>to serve people</strong>,
<strong>to repair the earth</strong>, and, when necessary, <strong>to
defend those under attack</strong> within strict moral limits.</p>
<h3 id="striving-against-the-self-jihād-al-nafs">Striving against the
self (jihād al-nafs)</h3>
<p>Conquering arrogance, greed, and anger; establishing prayer, honesty,
and patience. The Prophet ﷺ said the <strong>strong</strong> person is
not the one who overpowers others, but <strong>who controls
himself</strong> when angry (Bukhārī, Muslim).</p>
<h3 id="striving-with-knowledge-and-teaching">Striving with knowledge
and teaching</h3>
<p>Seeking knowledge is an obligation. Disseminating truth and
countering falsehood is part of jihād—<strong>pens before
swords</strong>. Reform is durable when <strong>minds</strong> and
<strong>hearts</strong> change.</p>
<h3 id="striving-with-service-and-care-for-creation">Striving with
service and care for creation</h3>
<p>Feeding the poor, healing the sick, building schools, and
<strong>protecting the environment</strong> are all jihād. Planting a
sapling even as the Hour approaches is rewarded (authentic meaning
reported in Musnad Aḥmad).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 30:41 (Arabic):</strong> ظَهَرَ الْفَسَادُ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ
أَيْدِي النَّاسِ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Corruption has appeared on land
and sea because of what people’s hands have earned.” <strong>Q 2:205
(Arabic):</strong> وَإِذَا تَوَلَّىٰ سَعَىٰ فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيهَا وَيُهْلِكَ الْحَرْثَ وَالنَّسْلَ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “When he turns away, he strives throughout the
land to cause corruption and destroy crops and descendants.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="defensive-struggle-when-attacked">Defensive struggle when
attacked</h3>
<p>Islam permits <strong>defense</strong> against aggression, expulsion,
and persecution—<strong>never</strong> transgression or targeting
innocents. The Qur’an sets clear boundaries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 22:39–40 (Arabic):</strong> أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ
ظُلِمُوا... وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَامِعُ وَبِيَعٌ...
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Permission [to fight] is given to those who
are fought because they were wronged… Had Allah not checked one people
by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques
would have been demolished.”</p>
<p><strong>Q 2:190 (Arabic):</strong> وَقَاتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ
يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوا <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Fight in the way of
Allah those who fight you, <strong>but do not transgress</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prophetic rules:</strong> No killing of non-combatants
(women, children, elderly), no mutilation, no treachery, no destroying
crops or animals, no demolishing homes or houses of worship (Bukhārī,
Muslim; instructions narrated from Abū Bakr to armies). This applies
whether resisting <strong>occupation</strong>, confronting
<strong>banditry</strong>, or defending one’s
<strong>family</strong>—always within law, restraint, and
accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Balance:</strong> Most of a believer’s life-jihād is
<strong>constructive</strong>—purifying the self, educating, building
just institutions, and protecting the vulnerable. Defensive force is
last-resort, bound by ethics.</p>
<h2 id="justice-in-markets-and-public-life">Justice in Markets and
Public Life</h2>
<p>Islam demands justice at both the <strong>market</strong> and
<strong>governance</strong> levels. Cheating the scale is condemned;
<strong>riba</strong> (usury/interest) is forbidden because it grows
money without real production or shared risk; and rulers are warned not
to govern by anything other than what Allah revealed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 83:1–3 (Arabic):</strong> وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ • الَّذِينَ إِذَا اكْتَالُوا
عَلَى النَّاسِ يَسْتَوْفُونَ • وَإِذَا كَالُوهُمْ أَو وَّزَنُوهُمْ يُخْسِرُونَ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Woe to those who give less in measure… when
they take, they take in full; when they measure for others, they give
less.”</p>
<p><strong>Q 2:275 (Arabic):</strong> أَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Allah has permitted <strong>trade</strong>
and forbidden <strong>riba</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>Q 5:44–47 (Arabic):</strong> وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ…
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Whoever does not judge by what Allah has
revealed—then they are the disbelievers… the wrongdoers… the defiantly
disobedient.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hadith — market ethics:</strong> “The buyer and the seller
have the option (to cancel) so long as they have not separated; if they
were truthful and clear, they will be blessed in their sale; if they
concealed and lied, the blessing of their sale will be erased.”
(Bukhārī, Muslim)</p>
<p><strong>Hadith — hoarding:</strong> “Whoever hoards (to raise prices)
is sinful.” (Reported in Muslim)</p>
<p>The Prophet ﷺ set rules that block hidden exploitation in exchange.
About <strong>ribāwī</strong> items, he said that <strong>gold for gold
and silver for silver</strong> must be <strong>like-for-like</strong>,
<strong>equal</strong>, and <strong>hand-to-hand</strong> when
exchanged; if they <strong>differ in type</strong>, the exchange must
still be <strong>spot (immediate)</strong>. He corrected
<strong>Bilāl</strong> when he swapped <strong>inferior for superior
dates</strong> on unequal terms, teaching that such a swap of the
<strong>same kind</strong> is the <strong>essence of riba</strong>; the
fair way is to <strong>sell for cash and then buy</strong> the better
dates (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim; Bukhārī in meaning).</p>
<p>These rules protect markets from stealth advantage and keep money as
a <strong>measure of value</strong>, not a tool for <strong>guaranteed
gain without risk</strong>. This underpins the preference for
<strong>intrinsic or asset-backed money</strong> over unconstrained
paper promises.</p>
<h2 id="money-should-track-real-value">Money Should Track Real
Value</h2>
<p>For centuries Muslims used <strong>gold (dīnār)</strong> and
<strong>silver (dirham)</strong>—monies with <strong>intrinsic
value</strong>. Islam’s concern is <strong>justice</strong>: money
should not become a device to <strong>create claims out of thin
air</strong> for a guaranteed return. That is why we will later argue
for <strong>asset-backed</strong> monetary design (e.g.,
<strong>Umicom</strong>)—transparent issuance against <strong>real,
auditable reserves</strong> and contracts that <strong>share
risk</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Historical note — Islamic coinage:</strong> Early Muslim
coinage standardized weights and Qur’anic inscriptions, discouraging
portraits and idolatrous symbols. Coins traveled across trade routes
from al-Andalus to China, supporting fair exchange.</p>
<h2 id="mercy-for-all-creation">Mercy for All Creation</h2>
<p>Islam extends mercy beyond humans. The Prophet ﷺ told of a woman
punished for <strong>mistreating a cat</strong>, and a man
<strong>forgiven</strong> for giving water to a thirsty dog (Bukhārī,
Muslim). Allah condemns environmental corruption and waste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 30:41 (Arabic):</strong> ظَهَرَ الْفَسَادُ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ
أَيْدِي النَّاسِ <strong>Meaning:</strong> “Corruption has appeared on land
and sea because of what people’s hands have earned.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Abū Bakr’s rules of engagement:</strong> When dispatching an
army, he advised, “Do not kill women, children, or the elderly; do not
mutilate; do not cut down fruitful trees; do not destroy inhabited
places; do not kill monks in monasteries.” Mercy and restraint are
Islamic law, not afterthoughts.</p>
<p>We are <strong>trustees</strong>: consume ethically, farm
responsibly, protect ecosystems, and avoid waste.</p>
<h2 id="courage-against-fear-mongering-and-hypocrisy">Courage against
Fear-Mongering and Hypocrisy</h2>
<p>During the <strong>Confederates’ siege</strong> of Madinah,
fear-mongers tried to paralyze the believers; true believers grew firmer
in reliance and action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 33:22 (Arabic):</strong> وَلَمَّا رَأَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلْأَحْزَابَ قَالُوا
هَٰذَا مَا وَعَدَنَا ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَصَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ ۚ وَمَا زَادَهُمْ إِلَّا إِيمَانًا وَتَسْلِيمًا
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “When the believers saw the confederates, they
said, ‘This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us,’ and it only
increased them in faith and submission.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are also commanded to <strong>verify news</strong> and refuse to
amplify panic or propaganda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 49:6 (Arabic):</strong> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن جَاءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ
بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا <strong>Meaning:</strong> “O you who believe! If a sinner
comes to you with news, verify it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hadith — stand for justice:</strong> “Support your brother
whether he is the oppressor or the oppressed.” They asked, “We know how
to help the oppressed; how do we help the oppressor?” He said, “By
preventing him from oppression.” (Bukhārī)</p>
<h2 id="satanic-divide-and-rule-vs-islams-unity">Satanic Divide-and-Rule
vs. Islam’s Unity</h2>
<p>From the first sin of <strong>arrogance</strong> (Q 7:12), Shayṭān’s
method is to plant <strong>“I am better”</strong>—the seed of racism and
classism. Ideologies that elevate one group as <strong>“chosen”</strong>
to dominate and dispossess others invert justice. History gives hard
lessons: <strong>Nazi Germany’s</strong> racial myth fueled catastrophic
war and genocide. In our time, <strong>Zionism as a political
project</strong> has produced the <strong>dispossession and occupation
of Palestine</strong>, repeated assaults on civilians, and systems of
<strong>apartheid-like control</strong>—all standing against the
Qur’anic commands of justice, sanctity of life, and equality of the
children of Ādam. Islam rejects <strong>all</strong> supremacist
doctrines—whether draped in race, nation, or religion. The remedy is
<strong>tawḥīd</strong> (one Creator), <strong>qisṭ</strong> (justice),
and <strong>ʿadl</strong> (fair dealing) applied to
<strong>everyone</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 4:135 (Arabic):</strong> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ
بِالْقِسْطِ شُهَدَاءَ لِلَّهِ… <strong>Meaning:</strong> “O you who believe, stand
firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if against yourselves or
parents and relatives…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Historical witness — Andalusian convivencia (imperfect but
real):</strong> Across centuries, Jews, Christians, and Muslims wrote
poetry, traded, and studied in a shared urban life. When power abused,
scholars protested; when justice ruled, cities flourished. Justice is
practical: contracts honored, minorities protected, courts open.</p>
<h2 id="short-quotes-from-notable-non-muslim-voices">Short Quotes from

</blockquote>
<h2 id="authors-note--why-i-refused-freemasonry">Author’s Note — Why I
Refused Freemasonry</h2>
<p>I was invited to join <strong>Freemasonry</strong> and declined,
because Islam requires transparent pledges to Allah alone, justice above
group loyalty, and avoidance of esoteric rites and secretive
allegiances.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secret oaths and layered allegiances</strong>: Islam
commands transparent pledges to Allah alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 16:91 (Arabic):</strong> وَأَوْفُوا بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ إِذَا عَاهَدتُّمْ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “Fulfill Allah’s covenant when you
pledge.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Brotherhood above justice</strong>: The Prophet ﷺ bound
us to justice <strong>even against ourselves</strong>. A closed
brotherhood that shields members conflicts with <strong>Q
4:135</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ritual symbolism and esoterica</strong>: Islam bars
avenues that resemble <strong>sorcery</strong> or occult symbolism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2:102</strong> warns against following the teachings of
devils and magic.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Secrecy that conceals harm</strong>: Islam’s rule is to
cooperate in <strong>birr</strong> and <strong>taqwā</strong>, not in
sin and aggression.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 5:2 (Arabic):</strong> وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ وَلَا
تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>For me, Islam’s clarity, public ethics, and accountability make such
secretive structures unnecessary and spiritually dangerous.</p>
<h2 id="building-character-from-intention-to-institutions">Building
Character: From Intention to Institutions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intention (niyyah):</strong> “Actions are by intentions.”
(Bukhārī, Muslim) Start with <strong>ikhlāṣ</strong> (sincerity), then
seek excellence (<strong>iḥsān</strong>) in craft, trade, and service.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 67:2 (Arabic):</strong> لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا — “…that He
may test you [to see] which of you is <strong>best</strong> in
deed.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Truthfulness (ṣidq):</strong> Truth sets contracts and
communities at ease.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 9:119 (Arabic):</strong> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا ٱللَّهَ
وَكُونُوا مَعَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Trust (amānah):</strong> Positions are a trust.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 4:58 (Arabic):</strong> إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُؤدُّوا ٱلْأَمَانَاتِ
إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهَا</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Brotherhood:</strong> “None of you truly believes until he
loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” (Bukhārī, Muslim)</li>
<li><strong>Institutions:</strong> Courts must be accessible; markets
transparent; rulers accountable; media honest; schools form integrity
and skill. Islam is not merely personal piety—it is the
<strong>architecture of justice</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="giving-and-serving--the-upper-hand">Giving and Serving — The
Upper Hand</h2>
<p>Islam trains us to be <strong>givers</strong> who lift others.
<strong>Zakāt</strong> purifies wealth; voluntary charity heals hearts;
<strong>service</strong> binds communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hadith (Bukhārī, Muslim):</strong> «الْيَدُ الْعُلْيَا خَيْرٌ مِنَ الْيَدِ
السُّفْلَى» <strong>Meaning:</strong> “The upper hand is better than the
lower hand.”</p>
<p><strong>Q 3:92 (Arabic):</strong> لَن تَنَالُوا الْبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنفِقُوا مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ
<strong>Meaning:</strong> “You will never attain righteousness until you
spend from what you love.”</p>

<h2 id="summary-refresher">Summary (Refresher)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allah created us with <strong>purpose</strong>: to know Him and do
right.</li>
<li><strong>All prophets and scriptures</strong> called to
<strong>Islam</strong>: worship Allah alone and uphold justice.</li>
<li><strong>Islam = submission</strong>—a mercy when embraced
<strong>completely</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Five Pillars</strong> interlock to build
time-management, commitment, sacrifice, and constant remembrance.</li>
<li><strong>Jihād</strong> is comprehensive striving: self-reform,
knowledge, service, environmental care, and ethical defense against
aggression—<strong>without transgression</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>One human family</strong>; racism and supremacism are
satanic diseases.</li>
<li><strong>No compulsion</strong>: guidance is clear; choice is free;
judgment is Allah’s.</li>
<li><strong>Prophets</strong> called to tawḥīd and justice (ISLAM - The
Complete Way of Life/The Perfect Blueprint to a successful life);
<strong>Qur’an’s signs</strong> invite reflection,
<strong>knowledge</strong> strengthens faith.</li>
<li><strong>Trade permitted, riba forbidden</strong>; fairness in
exchange is worship.</li>
<li><strong>Money</strong> should track <strong>real value</strong> and
<strong>share risk</strong>; we’ll propose <strong>Umicom Financial
Markets and Interensic Based Money</strong> later.</li>
<li><strong>Stand firm in justice</strong>; verify news; stop
oppression—including by those “on our side”.</li>
<li><strong>Serve</strong> more than you take; build institutions that
embody Qur’anic justice.</li>

raw_docs/starting-a-business/bookcover_Starting_Your_Own_Business.png
```text

**Volume slug rules:** lowercase, use hyphens: `generalist-ai`, `starting-a-business`.

---

## What the bot (CI) does for you

When you push to `main`:

1. **Markdown passthrough**
   - Copies `.md` from `raw_docs/&lt;slug&gt;/` → `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/`.
2. **DOCX → Markdown**
   - Converts `.docx` to `.md` (GitHub-Flavored Markdown).
   - Extracts embedded images to `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/images/&lt;basename&gt;/`.
3. **PDF → DOCX → Markdown (best-effort)**
   - Converts text-based `.pdf` to `.docx`, then to `.md`.
   - Scanned PDFs produce images; text quality depends on the source.
4. **Auto-number new chapters**
   - Renames fresh files to `chNN-&lt;slug&gt;.md` (e.g., `ch01-introduction.md`), only for files processed this run. Existing files are untouched.
5. **Normalize Markdown**
   - Adds YAML front-matter (title, volume, status, dates).
   - Ensures a top-level `# Title`.
   - Fixes blank code fences to use `text` (satisfies markdownlint MD040).

### Output lives in
```text
content/volumes/&lt;volume-slug&gt;/
```text

---

## Naming tips (optional but helpful)

- File names: short, lowercase, hyphenated:
  `distributed-systems-overview.md`, `risk-management.docx`
- One top-level heading in `.md`:
```markdown
# My Chapter Title
```text
- Code blocks:
```python
print(&quot;hello&quot;)
```text
(Use `text` if you’re unsure.)

---

## Quick scaffolding (optional helpers)

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# From the repo root
.    ools
ew-volume.ps1 generalist-ai
```text

### macOS/Linux (Bash)
```bash
# From the repo root
bash tools/new-volume.sh generalist-ai
```text

These create:
```text
raw_docs/&lt;slug&gt;/
content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/images/
content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/ch00-&lt;slug&gt;.md (placeholder)
```text

---

## Submitting work

- If you can edit the repo, **commit directly to `main`** under `raw_docs/&lt;slug&gt;/`.
- Otherwise, fork → branch → PR (the classic way).

That’s it. The bot will mirror/convert your files and you (the maintainer) review final content under `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/`.



## Volumes Index

# Volumes — Index

Quick links to each volume, where to upload drafts, and where finalized Markdown lands.

&gt; Upload chapters to `raw_docs/&lt;slug&gt;/`. The ingest bot mirrors/normalizes them into `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/`.

| Volume | Slug | Upload here (raw) | Output (normalized Markdown) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Volume 0 — Project Intro | `volume-0` | &lt;https://github.com/umicom-foundation/Bits2Banking/tree/main/raw_docs/volume-0&gt; | &lt;https://github.com/umicom-foundation/Bits2Banking/tree/main/content/volumes/volume-0&gt; |
| Volume 1 — Introduction to Islam | `introduction-to-islam` | &lt;https://github.com/umicom-foundation/Bits2Banking/tree/main/raw_docs/introduction-to-islam&gt; | &lt;https://github.com/umicom-foundation/Bits2Banking/tree/main/content/volumes/introduction-to-islam&gt; |
| Volume 2 — Bits to Banking | `bits-to-banking` | &lt;https://github.com/umicom-foundation/Bits2Banking/tree/main/raw_docs/bits-to-banking&gt; | &lt;https://github.com/umicom-foundation/Bits2Banking/tree/main/content/volumes/bits-to-banking&gt; |

## How to add a new volume (quick)
1. Create a folder: `raw_docs/&lt;your-volume-slug&gt;/`
2. Add `.md`, `.docx`, or `.pdf` (optional: `bookcover_&lt;Title&gt;.png`)
3. Commit to `main` — the bot writes normalized `.md` into `content/volumes/&lt;slug&gt;/`

## Python Primer for Contributors


# Python Primer for Contributors

This is a **practical crash course**: just enough Python to read, tweak, and trust our scripts.

## 1) Running Python

```bash
python --version
python scripts/ingest.py
```text

(If a virtual environment is used, we’ll document it in the script header.)

## 2) Paths with `pathlib`

```python
from pathlib import Path

repo = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]
raw = repo / &quot;raw_docs&quot;
content = repo / &quot;content&quot;
for p in raw.glob(&quot;**/*&quot;):
    print(p)
```text

## 3) Reading and writing text files

```python
from pathlib import Path

text = Path(&quot;example.md&quot;).read_text(encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;)
Path(&quot;out.md&quot;).write_text(text, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;)
```text

## 4) Recognising chapters by filename

We keep human‑friendly names with spaces. To detect chapters reliably, match patterns like `chapter&lt;number&gt;_Title.ext` (case‑insensitive).

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path

chapter_re = re.compile(r&quot;chapter\s*(\d+)&quot;, re.IGNORECASE)

def chapter_num(path: Path) -&gt; int | None:
    m = chapter_re.search(path.stem)
    return int(m.group(1)) if m else None
```text

## 5) Ordering chapters safely (idempotent)

```python
def order_chapters(paths):
    with_numbers = [(chapter_num(p), p) for p in paths]
    # Sort: numbered first (by number), then the rest by name
    with_numbers.sort(key=lambda t: (t[0] is None, t[0] if t[0] is not None else 10**9, str(t[1]).lower()))
    return [p for _, p in with_numbers]
```text

Gaps (e.g., chapter 1, 2, 4) won’t break ordering; chapter 4 just comes after 2.

## 6) Inferring metadata from filenames

When metadata is missing, we infer from the filename: title and (if present) author/date tokens.

```python
def infer_title(path: Path) -&gt; str:
    # Strip &#39;chapterN_&#39; prefix if present and use remaining words
    name = chapter_re.sub(&quot;&quot;, path.stem).strip(&quot; _-&quot;)
    return name.replace(&quot;_&quot;, &quot; &quot;).strip() or path.stem
```text

## 7) Combining chapters into one Markdown

```python
def combine_markdown(chapter_files, title):
    parts = [f&quot;# {title}\n\n&quot;]
    for f in chapter_files:
        parts.append(Path(f).read_text(encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;).strip() + &quot;\n\n&quot;)
    return &quot;\n&quot;.join(parts)
```text

## 8) Clear, human error messages

Whenever something goes wrong, print messages that explain **what** and **how to fix**:

```python
def error(msg: str):
    raise SystemExit(f&quot;[ERROR] {msg}\nPlease check the filename or content and try again.&quot;)
```text

Examples:
- Missing cover image → “Cover not found. Place an image named ‘cover.*’ alongside the manuscript.”
- Bad image path in a chapter → “Image ‘assets/fig1.png’ not found. Ensure it exists and the path is correct.”

## 9) Converting Markdown → DOCX/PDF (overview)

Tools we may use (documented elsewhere in the repo):
- `pandoc` for `.md` → `.docx`/`.pdf`
- Python wrappers or shell commands to drive Pandoc

Example shell (conceptual):

```bash
pandoc book.md -o book.docx --resource-path=.:assets
pandoc book.md -o book.pdf  --resource-path=.:assets
```text

## 10) Tiny exercise (optional)

- Create two files: `chapter1_Intro.md` and `chapter5_Advanced.md` with one heading each.
- Use the `order_chapters` function to verify ordering is 1 then 5.
- Infer titles with `infer_title` and print them.
- Combine the two into one Markdown string.

That’s the practical Python you’ll see in our scripts.

## history of money

﻿# Chapter 2 — History of Money (5,000 Years) and Islam’s Ethic of Trade

Money is a tool. In righteous hands and just systems, it enables exchange, investment, and prosperity. In corrupt systems, it becomes an engine of exploitation. Islam enters this story with a **moral compass**: honest weights, fair contracts, real assets, shared risk, and a strict prohibition of **riba** (interest/usury). This chapter surveys money’s long arc—from barter to bullion to banknotes to today’s fiat—then shows how Islam corrected abuse and built trust.

## 2.1 Why Study Money

Because money shapes **daily life**: wages, food prices, savings, charity, and public services. If money can be created at will by a few or chained to interest, it will quietly transfer wealth from the many to the few. Islam commands **justice** and **measure**:

&gt; وَأَقِيمُوا الْوَزْنَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلَا تُخْسِرُوا الْمِيزَانَ (الرحمن 9)
&gt; *“Establish weight in justice and do not fall short in the balance.”* (Q 55:9)
&gt;
&gt; وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا اكْتَالُوا عَلَى النَّاسِ يَسْتَوْفُونَ وَإِذَا كَالُوهُمْ أَوْ وَّزَنُوهُمْ يُخْسِرُونَ (المطففين 1–3)
&gt; *“Woe to those who give less in measure—who, when they receive by measure from people, take in full; but when they measure or weigh for them, give less.”* (Q 83:1–3)

## 2.2 A Quick Timeline (5,000 Years)

- **Barter → Commodity Money:** Early markets swapped goods; then widely valued commodities (salt, grain, beads, livestock) became money.
- **Metals (Copper, Silver, Gold):** Durable, divisible, and portable. Ancient Lydia minted coins (~7th c. BCE); weights/assays built trust.
- **Islamic Era (7th–10th c. CE):** With Islam’s spread, **ethics** and **law** standardized trade across continents. Contracts (murābaḥah, muḍārabah), trust networks, and **sound coinage** supported huge caravans and maritime routes.
- **Bills of Exchange &amp; Paper:** Merchants used promissory notes and **sakk** (cheques). Later, state paper claims to metal emerged.
- **Banking &amp; Central Banking:** Receipts for deposited gold/silver circulated as money; over-issuance led to panics. Central banks arose to backstop banks—often socializing losses.
- **Fiat Era (1971→):** The US ended dollar–gold convertibility; fiat currencies float. Now money is ledger entries created largely via **interest-bearing debt**.

## 2.3 Arabia Before Islam → Caravans and Markets

Pre-Islamic Arabia had seasonal markets (e.g., ʿUkāẓ), trade caravans between Yemen–Shām, and exposure to Byzantine and Sasanian coins. Economic life was vibrant but **uneven**: cheating in measure, usurious debt, and predatory contracts existed. Islam confronted this with **honesty**, **mercy**, and **law**—preserving enterprise while removing exploitation.

## 2.4 The Prophet ﷺ as a Trader

The Prophet ﷺ worked as a merchant, **sincere and trustworthy** (al-Ṣādiq al-Amīn). He partnered with **Khadīja** (رضي الله عنها), honoring contracts and sharing profits fairly. He taught that trade must be free of fraud, deception, and riba. **Trust**—truthful disclosure, timely payment, fulfillment—was the currency that multiplied business and brought **barakah** (blessing).

## 2.5 Contracts Islam Encouraged

- **Muḍārabah** — investor provides capital, entrepreneur provides effort; profits shared by ratio; **losses** borne by capital unless negligence.
- **Mushārakah** — equity partnership; profits by agreement, losses by capital share.
- **Murābaḥah** — cost-plus sale of a real, owned asset (not a disguised loan).
- **Salam &amp; Istisnāʿ** — pre-paid/agreed manufacture for real needs, with clarity and delivery terms.
- **Ijārah** — leasing use-rights, not selling forbidden uncertainty.

These reflect Islam’s rule: **no guaranteed return without bearing risk** and **no money-from-money** without real trade or assets.

## 2.6 Islamic Coinage and Global Finance

Under **ʿAbd al-Malik** (Umayyad), the first **purely Islamic dinars/dirhams** were minted: Qur’anic inscriptions, no portraits, stable weights. Bimetallic standards (gold dinar, silver dirham) created reliable pricing across regions and centuries. Muslim merchants stitched together trade from **al-Andalus to China**, using fair contracts and credible coinage.

&gt; وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا (البقرة 275)
&gt; *“Allah has permitted trade and forbidden riba.”* (Q 2:275)

## 2.7 Riba in Exchange — Why “Intrinsic Value” Matters

The Prophet ﷺ defined exchange of **ribawi** items:

&gt; «الذَّهَبُ بِالذَّهَبِ، وَالْفِضَّةُ بِالْفِضَّةِ، وَالْبُرُّ بِالْبُرِّ، وَالشَّعِيرُ بِالشَّعِيرِ، وَالتَّمْرُ بِالتَّمْرِ، وَالْمِلْحُ بِالْمِلْحِ، مِثْلًا بِمِثْلٍ، يَدًا بِيَدٍ؛ فَإِذَا اخْتَلَفَتْ هَذِهِ الأَصْنَافُ فَبِيعُوا كَيْفَ شِئْتُمْ إِذَا كَانَ يَدًا بِيَدٍ» (مسلم)
&gt; *“Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, and salt for salt—like for like, equal for equal, hand to hand; if the kinds differ, sell as you wish, so long as it is hand to hand.”* (Muslim)

**Bilāl’s dates** example shows **riba al-faḍl**: unequal swap of the same kind on the spot is forbidden. The principle protects markets from **hidden exploitation**. From this, scholars derived that **money**—being a standard of value—should not become a tool to **extract value without risk**. Our project’s thesis (to be debated respectfully) is that **fiat**—created at will and lent at interest—facilitates systemic riba and **hidden taxation via inflation**, whereas **asset-backed** or intrinsically valuable money better aligns with Islamic aims.

&gt; وَمَا آتَيْتُم مِّن رِّبًا لِّيَرْبُوَا فِي أَمْوَالِ النَّاسِ فَلَا يَرْبُوا عِندَ اللَّهِ (الروم 39)
&gt; *“What you give in riba to increase within the wealth of people does not increase with Allah.”* (Q 30:39)

## 2.8 Supremacist Empires, Colonial Currency, and Modern Apartheid-Like Controls

History shows that **supremacist ideologies** weaponize money. Empires imposed currency boards and debt to control colonies. In the 20th century, **Nazism** dehumanized minorities and plundered economies. In recent times, **Zionism as a political project** has produced policies—**dispossession, settlement expansion, and collective punishment**—that crush Palestinian economic life. Checkpoints, blockades, and permit regimes function like **financial throttles**: they fragment markets, destroy family wealth, and trap youth in unemployment. Islam condemns such oppression and calls us to defend the weak, speak truth, and build **halal alternatives**.

&gt;… مَن قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعًا (المائدة 32)
&gt; *“…whoever kills a soul—unless [in retribution] or for (grave) corruption in the land—it is as if he had slain all mankind.”* (Q 5:32)
&gt;
&gt; يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ (المائدة 8)
&gt; *“O you who believe! Be steadfast for Allah, witnesses in justice.”* (Q 5:8)

## 2.9 Lessons for Today

- **Sound money** (gold/silver or strong asset-backing) restrains arbitrary creation, aligns with **real economy**, and discourages riba.
- **Contracts** must link financing to **real assets/work**, not to compounding debt.
- **Justice** in policy: end structures that strip wealth from the vulnerable by design.
- **Build** halal rails—transparent, asset-backed instruments; ethical fintech; community funds.

This is the road toward our **Umicom Asset-Backed Security Coin**: a Shariah-aligned unit of account and exchange anchored to verified, audited assets—constructed to **serve people**, not exploit them.

## Supplication (Duʿāʾ)

### Arabic
اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ لَنَا فِي رِزْقِنَا، وَاجْعَلْ مَالَنَا قُوَّةً لِلطَّاعَةِ، وَحِصْنًا مِنَ الظُّلْمِ، وَنَجِّنَا مِنَ الرِّبَا وَمِنْ نُظُمِ الظُّلْمِ، وَارْزُقْنَا صِدْقًا فِي الْبَيْعِ وَالشِّرَاءِ وَالْعُقُودِ.

### English
### O Allah, bless our provision; make our wealth a strength for obedience and a shield against injustice; save us from riba and oppressive systems; and grant us truthfulness in buying, selling, and contracts

## Chapter Summary (Refresher)

- Money’s form changed across millennia, but Islam’s **ethic** stayed constant: honest measure, fair exchange, no riba.
- The Prophet ﷺ modeled trustworthy trade; Islamic contracts align **profit with risk** and **finance with real assets**.
- **Ribawi rules** (gold/silver, like-for-like, hand-to-hand) protect markets from exploitation.
- **Fiat + interest** tends to centralize power and silently tax the poor; **asset-backed** money better serves justice.
- Supremacist projects—from Nazism to modern apartheid-like policies—weaponize money; Islam commands we **stand for justice** and **build alternatives**.




## Chapter 3 The Decline of Sound Money

﻿
# Chapter 3 — The Decline of Sound Money

## 3.1 Colonialism and currency control
European empires conquered lands and **replaced intrinsic money** with currencies tied to their banks. Debt and taxation in foreign money created dependence.

## 3.2 From receipts to fiat
Paper began as a **claim on gold/silver**. Over time, issuers printed more notes than reserves → **fiat** (value by decree).

## 3.3 Bretton Woods (1944) → 1971
The dollar was pegged to gold at $35/oz; the world pegged to the dollar. In **1971**, the dollar left gold entirely. From then on: unlimited printing and chronic inflation.

&gt; **“Woe to those who give less than due…”** *(Al‑Muṭaffifīn 83:1–3)* — inflation quietly reduces people’s purchasing power.

## 3.4 Riba and the debt engine
Loans are created with **interest**; money to pay the interest does not exist unless new debt is issued. Nations and families become permanent debtors.

&gt; **“…If you do not desist, then be informed of a war from Allah and His Messenger.”**
&gt; **فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُوا فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ** *(Al‑Baqarah 2:279)*

## 3.5 The 2008 lesson
Risky mortgages were bundled and sold as safe. When borrowers defaulted, the system crashed. Banks were rescued by money printing; ordinary people were not.

## 3.6 Why this matters
- Inflation is **hidden theft** from savers and workers.
- Riba concentrates wealth with lenders.
- Sound money and just contracts are **moral necessities**, not nostalgia.

### Supplication
### اللَّهُمَّ نَجِّنَا مِنْ ظُلْمِ الرِّبَا، وَاهْدِنَا لِبِنَاءِ نِظَامٍ عَادِلٍ قَائِمٍ عَلَى شَرِيعَتِكَ
### O Allah, save us from the oppression of riba and guide us to build a just system based on Your Sharīʿah

## Chapter 4 Modern Banking and Finance

﻿
# Chapter 4 — Modern Banking and Finance

## 4.1 How banks create money
When a bank issues a loan, it **credits** the borrower’s account with new deposits — money created from nothing — then demands repayment **plus interest**.

## 4.2 Central banks and governments
Governments sell bonds; central banks buy them with newly created reserves. Taxpayers carry the **interest burden**.

&gt; **“Allah destroys riba and gives increase for charities.”**
&gt; **يَمْحَقُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّبَا وَيُرْبِى ٱلصَّدَقَـٰتِ** *(Al‑Baqarah 2:276)*

## 4.3 Why it collapses
Debt must grow to service past interest. Eventually, defaults rise; the state prints more money → inflation. The cycle repeats.

## 4.4 Real‑world impacts (case snapshots)
- **Student debt (US)** — lifelong repayments for millions.
- **IMF programs** — currency devaluation and austerity.
- **Egypt** — repeated devaluations crush wages and savings.
- **Gaza** — transfers blocked; fees consume aid.

&gt; **“A time will come when everyone will consume riba; if he does not consume it, its dust will reach him.”** *(Abū Dāwūd 3331)*

## 4.5 Islam’s alternative at a glance
- **Mudarabah/Musharakah** — risk‑sharing, not risk‑shifting.
- **Ijarah** — fair leasing.
- **Zakat/Waqf** — social safety and productive endowments.

### Supplication
### اللَّهُمَّ عَلِّمْنَا مَا يَنْفَعُنَا، وَانْفَعْنَا بِمَا عَلَّمْتَنَا، وَارْزُقْنَا مَالًا حَلَالًا طَيِّبًا
### O Allah, teach us what benefits us, benefit us through what You have taught us, and grant us pure halal wealth

## Chapter 5 Technology and Banking

﻿
# Chapter 5 — Technology and Banking

## 5.1 Bits to value
Computers store and move **bits (0/1)**. Your bank balance is a number in a **database**.

## 5.2 Banking tech stack (simplified)
- **Core banking systems** — accounts, payments, loans.
- **Treasury/Capital Markets** — platforms like Calypso/Murex for trading &amp; risk.
- **Databases** — Oracle/SQL store transactions.
- **Messaging** — SWIFT/FIX/FpML move instructions between banks.

## 5.3 Milestones
- **Sakk** (cheques) and **hawāla** — Islamic Golden Age.
- **Double‑entry** — merchant accounting revolution.
- **Telegraph** → early electronic transfers.
- **SWIFT (1973)**, **ATMs (1967)**, **online/mobile banking**.
- **Blockchain (2009–)** — distributed ledgers (powerful but often speculative when unbacked).

## 5.4 Why Islam matters here
Tech is a tool. Without Sharīʿah principles (no riba/gharar/maysir; real assets; transparency), technology can **amplify injustice**.

### Supplication
### اللَّهُمَّ وَفِّقْنَا لِتَسْخِيرِ التِّقْنِيَةِ فِي الْخَيْرِ وَالْعَدْلِ
### O Allah, enable us to harness technology for good and justice

## Chapter 6 Islamic Finance The Future

﻿
# Chapter 6 — Islamic Finance &amp; The Future

## 6.1 Core prohibitions
- **Riba (interest)** — guaranteed gain on loans.
- **Gharar** — excessive uncertainty/ambiguity.
- **Maysir** — gambling/speculation.

## 6.2 Halal contracts
**Mudarabah, Musharakah, Ijarah, Murabaha, Salam, Sukuk** — real assets, real risk.

&gt; **“Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly; only [in lawful] trade by mutual consent.”**
&gt; **وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَن تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ** *(An‑Nisāʾ 4:29)*

## 6.3 Global snapshots
- **Malaysia** — sukuk leadership; strong regulation.
- **Gulf** — scale &amp; ambition; risk of mimicking conventional debt.
- **Pakistan** — legal push toward riba‑free; tough implementation.
- **Sudan** — system‑wide adoption hindered by governance.
- **London** — Western hub showing cross‑faith trust.

## 6.4 Pitfalls &amp; crises
- **Asian Crisis (1997)** — hot money &amp; devaluations.
- **Dubai 2009** — over‑leveraged projects; sukuk design lessons.
- **Cosmetic “Islamic” products** — form without substance.

## 6.5 Everyday impact
- **Families** — musharakah housing vs. interest mortgages.
- **SMEs** — risk‑sharing finance instead of debt traps.
- **Poor** — zakat, waqf, **qard ḥasan** dignity.
- **Environment** — stewardship (khilāfah), no waste/corruption.

### Supplication
### اللَّهُمَّ طَهِّرْ أَمْوَالَنَا، وَبَارِكْ فِي مَعَاشِنَا، وَاجْعَلْنَا مِفْتَاحًا لِلْخَيْرِ
### O Allah, purify our wealth, bless our livelihoods, and make us keys to goodness

## Chapter 7 Recap Volume 1 Summary


# Chapter 7 Recap — Volume 1 Summary

- Islam is a complete way of life; justice in trade is worship.
- History shows sound money → stability; debasement → collapse.
- Modern banking creates money as debt; riba enslaves.
- Technology runs finance; without Sharīʿah it amplifies injustice.
- Islamic finance = real assets, risk‑sharing, zakat/waqf.
- Umicom ABS Coin = asset‑backed, transparent, redeemable.

## اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنَا مِنْ أَهْلِ الصِّدْقِ وَالْعَدْلِ، وَوَفِّقْنَا لِخِدْمَةِ خَلْقِكَ
### O Allah, make us people of truth and justice, and grant us success in serving Your creation

## Chapter 7 Umicom ABS Coin AssetBacked SharīʿahCompliant

﻿
# Chapter 7 — Umicom ABS Coin (Asset‑Backed, Sharīʿah‑Compliant)

## 7.1 The need
- Fiat inflates away savings.
- Unbacked crypto is speculative.
- Many “Islamic” products mimic interest finance.

## 7.2 What Umicom is
A **digital coin backed by real assets** (gold, silver, food, energy, commodities), recorded on a transparent ledger with redeemability.

**Sharīʿah fit:** no riba, no gharar (clear assets/terms), no maysir (value from assets, not chance).

## 7.3 How it works (simple flow)
1) **Assets deposited** → coins minted.
2) **Circulation** → trade, remittances, aid, SME finance.
3) **Redemption** → coin returned for underlying assets.

## 7.4 Who benefits
- **Families** — savings that keep purchasing power.
- **Businesses** — stable unit of account for trade.
- **Communities in crisis** — direct, low‑fee aid.
- **Nations** — issue value tied to real output.

## 7.5 Case sketches
- **Gaza** — aid without 50% transfer losses.
- **Egypt** — inflation‑resistant savings.
- **Africa** — tokenise resources; avoid dollar debt.
- **Remittances** — instant, near‑zero‑cost.

&gt; **“And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance.”** *(Ar‑Raḥmān 55:9)*

### Supplication
### اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ فِي مَشْرُوعِ Umicom، وَاجْعَلْهُ سَبِيلًا لِلْعَدْلِ وَالْمَنْفَعَةِ لِلنَّاسِ
### O Allah, bless the Umicom project and make it a path to justice and benefit for people

## Contributor Basics


# Contributor Basics

Welcome! This short guide helps you (and future contributors) understand the **minimum YAML and Python** needed to read and trust our scripts and automation.

## Chapters

- [YAML in 10 Minutes (for this project)](yaml-for-contributors.md)
- [Python Primer for Contributors](python-primer-for-contributors.md)

&gt; Tip: Keep UK English spelling in docs and comments.



## YAML in 10 Minutes for this project


# YAML in 10 Minutes (for this project)

YAML is a human‑readable format used for configuration—**indentation matters** and uses **spaces only**.

## 1) The absolute basics

### Mappings (key → value)

```yaml
name: Content sanity check
enabled: true
retries: 3
```text

### Lists

```yaml
books:
  - Effective Communication
  - Contributor Basics
  - Leadership &amp; Teamwork
```text

### Nesting (indent with 2 spaces)

```yaml
book:
  title: Effective Communication
  author: Tamkin Riaz
  modules:
    - Understanding the Communication Process
    - Active Listening
```text

&gt; **Important:** Do **not** use tabs. YAML requires spaces. Mixed tabs/spaces cause hard‑to‑read errors.

## 2) Strings and quoting

Unquoted is fine if there are no special characters. Quote when in doubt.

```yaml
title: Effective Communication
safe: &quot;Yes — includes punctuation, : and # are safe here&quot;
path: &quot;content/effective-communication-course/index.md&quot;
```text

Multi‑line strings:

```yaml
description: |
  This course includes:
  - Verbal and non‑verbal communication
  - Listening skills
  - Written communication
```text

## 3) GitHub Actions: minimal anatomy

```yaml
name: Content sanity check

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - &quot;content/**&quot;
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - &quot;content/**&quot;

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run a shell command
        run: echo &quot;Hello YAML&quot;
```text

Key parts you’ll see often:

- `on`: events that trigger the workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
- `jobs`: one or more tasks to run.
- `runs-on`: the virtual machine image.
- `steps`: a sequence of actions or shell commands.
- `uses`: re‑use an action.
- `run`: execute a shell command.

## 4) Common mistakes (and how to fix them)

### A) Mixed indentation (tabs vs spaces)

**Problem:** “mapping values are not allowed here” or cryptic errors.  
**Fix:** Ensure only spaces are used; keep consistent indentation (commonly 2 spaces).

### B) Misaligned list items

```yaml
steps:
    - name: One
      run: echo one
  - name: Two  # ← Misaligned under &#39;steps&#39;
    run: echo two
```text

**Fix:** Align the dashes under the same indent level:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: One
    run: echo one
  - name: Two
    run: echo two
```text

### C) Unintended colon in unquoted strings

```yaml
title: Effective Communication: A Practical Guide   # may parse oddly
```text

**Fix:** Quote it:

```yaml
title: &quot;Effective Communication: A Practical Guide&quot;
```text

### D) Trailing spaces after keys

```yaml
name : Value   # ← space before colon not recommended
```text

**Fix:**

```yaml
name: Value
```text

## 5) Advanced (rarely needed, but good to know)

### Anchors &amp; aliases

```yaml
defaults: &amp;defaults
  retries: 2
  timeout: 30

job:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
  retries: 3  # override
```text

### Environment variables in Actions

```yaml
env:
  PYTHONWARNINGS: &quot;ignore&quot;
  APP_ENV: &quot;prod&quot;
```text

## 6) Quick checklist before committing

- Spaces only, consistent indent (2 spaces works well).
- Quote strings with `:` or `#` or special characters.
- Lists aligned at the same column.
- Run your workflow locally if possible or rely on CI feedback.

That’s it—you’re good to read and adjust YAML in this project.

## 0009 Governance Firewalls Designing for Justice

# 0009 — Governance Firewalls: Designing for Justice

It’s not enough to denounce corruption; we must **engineer against it**—in constitutions, budgets, and code.

## Principles (Qur’an &amp; Sunnah)

- **Justice (al-ʿadl):** judge fairly (Q 4:58; Q 5:8).
- **Trusts (amānāt):** render trusts to their people (Q 4:58).
- **No riba/bribery:** end structures that reward extraction (Q 2:275; 2:188).
- **Consultation (shūrā):** participatory decision-making (Q 42:38).

## Institutional firewalls (policy)

1) **Public money, public ledgers:** machine-readable budgets, procurement, and transfers.
2) **Conflict-of-interest regimes:** mandatory disclosures, recusal rules, gift registers.
3) **Open tendering:** competitive bids; publish contracts; blacklist offenders.
4) **Independent audit &amp; courts:** tenure-protected, budget-independent.
5) **Civic oversight:** FOI laws, whistleblower shields, protected press.
6) **Zakat &amp; waqf governance:** clear mandates, audited distribution dashboards.

## Financial firewalls (design)

- **No guaranteed return without risk.**
- **Asset-backed issuance:** money linked to real goods/services.
- **Capital buffers &amp; liquidity corridors** that don’t socialize losses.
- **Real-time transparency:** traceable flows (with privacy safeguards).
- **Smart contracts with Shariah checks:** automated compliance (no interest leg, ownership transfer before sale, etc.).

## Pattern kit (checklists)

- **Procurement checklist:** publish RFP → open bids → award rationale → contract text → delivery milestones → payments log.
- **Public-funds checklist:** inflow sources → allocation rules → disbursement proofs → independent audit → citizen feedback loop.
- **Shariah audit checklist:** contract type → ownership/risk → pricing transparency → settlement timing → no riba/gharar/maysir.

## Toward Umicom (teaser)

A **Shariah-aligned, asset-backed digital unit** can encode these firewalls: issuance against **audited reserves**, on-chain proofs of assets and liabilities, contracts that enforce **risk sharing** and **fair exchange**, and governance that regular people can verify.

## Duʿāʾ

اللَّهُمَّ أَقِمْ بَيْنَنَا قِسْطًا، وَانْصُرْ مَنْ نَصَرَ الْحَقَّ، وَاخْذُلْ مَنْ خَانَ الْأَمَانَةَ.
O Allah, establish justice among us, support those who support truth, and thwart those who betray trusts.

## 0008 Hall of Shame Collaboration Corruption and Betrayal

# 0008 — Hall of Shame: Collaboration, Corruption, and Betrayal

This chapter documents **patterns** of collaboration with oppressors and **historical cases** backed by public records. The aim is reform, not rage.

&gt; **Q 4:135:** Stand firm for justice, witnesses for Allah—even against yourselves.
&gt; **Q 2:188:** Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly or use it to bribe rulers.

## Why leaders sell out

- **Private gain:** money, property, immunity, titles.
- **Foreign leverage:** threats/sanctions or promises of support.
- **Weak institutions:** no audits, no free press, no independent courts.
- **Decayed ethics:** riba-soaked economies that reward extraction.

## Documented historical examples (illustrative)

- **Benedict Arnold** (1780): plotted to surrender West Point for money and rank.
- **Vidkun Quisling** (1940–45): Nazi collaborator in Norway.
- **Philippe Pétain** (Vichy France): collaborationist regime, convicted post-war.
- **Wang Jingwei** (WWII China): Japanese-backed government in Nanjing.
- **Andrey Vlasov** (WWII): led Russian Liberation Army with the Nazis.
- **Mīr Jaʿfar** (1757): defected at Plassey; opened Bengal to Company control.
- **Ephialtes** (480 BCE): betrayed the pass at Thermopylae for reward.
- **Sale of Joan of Arc** (1430): captured then ransomed to enemies.

(*A separate appendix can house extended dossiers with sources.*)

## Islamic framing

- **Rule by revelation, not bribery.**
- **Strong contracts and public ledgers.**
- **Shūrā (consultation)** and independent judiciary.
- **Zakat/waqf** as social floors that weaken “sell-out” incentives.

## Summary

Betrayal recurs across civilizations. Only **systems**—ethical finance, transparent governance, real accountability—cure the disease.

## Duʿāʾ

اللَّهُمَّ احْفَظْ أُمَّتَنَا مِنْ خَوَانَةِ الْأَمَانَةِ، وَارْزُقْنَا قَادَةً عَادِلِينَ، وَانْصُرِ الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي كُلِّ مَكَانٍ.
O Allah, protect our community from betrayal, grant us just leaders, and aid the oppressed everywhere.
