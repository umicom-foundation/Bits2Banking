# About — Bits to Banking

Bits to Banking is an **open book project** created by the **Umicom Foundation**.  
It teaches computing from the ground up — **bits → operating systems → programming → databases → networking → security → finance → Calypso/TMS** — in small, printable volumes that anyone can follow.

## 🎯 Why We Started

The project was inspired by two connected missions:

1. **Education for all** — to create free, beginner-friendly resources so that kids, teens, and adults can learn computing step by step.  
2. **Relief for those in need** — to channel knowledge-building into direct **humanitarian support for civilians in Gaza and other crisis zones**.

By combining **technical education** with **humanitarian action**, we aim to empower people not only with skills but also with hope.
