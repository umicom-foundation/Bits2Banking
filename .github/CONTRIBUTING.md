  A short intro goes here.

## Style Guide (Simple Rules)

- Use `#` for chapter titles, `##` for subsections.  
- Write in clear, beginner-friendly English.  
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences).  
- Lists should have a blank line above them.  
- Use code fences with language, e.g.:
  ```python
  print("Hello world")
  ```

## Community & Conduct

We value:
- Respect and patience (everyone is learning).  
- Contributions of all sizes (fix a typo, add a paragraph, or write a chapter).  
- Transparency â€” all donations and outputs go directly to help civilians in need.  

If youâ€™re unsure about anything, open a **Discussion** or ask in your Pull Request.
