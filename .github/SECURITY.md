# Security Policy â€” Bits to Banking

We take security seriously. Thank you for helping us keep this project safe for everyone.

---

## Supported Versions

The project is under active development. Security updates will be applied to the **main branch** only.  
If you are using a fork or older branch, please update regularly.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, report it responsibly by one of the following methods:

1. **Email** the maintainers: contact details are in the project README.  
2. If you are unsure, open a GitHub issue with minimal detail and request a private channel.  

We aim to acknowledge all reports within **7 days** and provide a fix or mitigation as soon as possible.

## Scope

This project includes:

- Python build scripts (`scripts/`)  
- Markdown content (`chapters/`, `docs/`)  
- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)  
- Published artifacts (generated `.docx` volumes, MkDocs site)  

Please focus security reports on these areas.  

---

## Exclusions

- Typos, grammar issues, or Markdown linting are **not security issues**.  
- Problems in external dependencies (e.g. `python-docx`) should be reported upstream.

## Why This Matters

Bits to Banking is not just educational â€” it is tied to **Umicom Foundationâ€™s humanitarian mission**.  
We want to ensure all contributions and outputs are safe, secure, and trustworthy.
