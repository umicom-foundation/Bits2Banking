# Statement review laboratory

Learn how a banking client turns imported observations into a review that can be explained, checked and reopened. Follow one small program that calls the shared Framework services.

## Setup and run

This laboratory is a small C program. A compiler translates its source into an executable; CMake describes the build and Ninja runs the required build steps. Use an installed Umicom Framework SDK containing the bank_feed component, a C23 compiler, CMake and Ninja from the same toolchain. On Windows, open PowerShell and use the UCRT64 tools. An SDK is a set of headers and libraries used by another program; these commands consume it rather than rebuild Framework.

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Enter the commands below, using your installed SDK directory if it differs.
3. Read the configure result before building. If CMake cannot find UmicomFrameworkConfig.cmake or the bank_feed component, install the matching SDK first; do not replace the library with a local imitation.
4. Run the executable, then the registered laboratory check. A failing check prints its source line and exits with a nonzero status.

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\umicom\Umicom-Bits2Banking\labs\framework\statement-review"
$env:Path = "C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;$env:Path"
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/umicom/installed/applications" -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build --parallel 2
& ".\build\btb-statement-review.exe"
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```
On Linux, use the same source and an SDK built for Linux. In Bash, run cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/your/sdk/path -DBUILD_TESTING=ON, then cmake --build build, ./build/btb-statement-review and ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure --no-tests=error. Replace /your/sdk/path with the actual installation directory. Windows libraries cannot be linked into a Linux executable.

Open main.c in a text editor to follow the calls. The program uses fictional observations held in memory; it does not connect to a bank or change any account. The [Learning C course](../../../content/courses/learning-c/index.html) explains declarations and control flow in more depth.

## Follow the course

Start with [Read a statement as observations](../../../content/courses/framework-and-finance/banking-and-payments/lessons/11-read-a-statement-as-observations.html). The eight lessons explain the calls, amounts, scope, archive ownership, failure paths and qualification steps.

Expected output includes the equation `100.00 + 12.50 - 2.25 = 110.25 GBP`, a reopened review, a `1.00` discrepancy and rejection of an invalid later row. No file is written and no account is changed.
