## 🌍 Humanitarian Impact

Every contribution also supports **Umicom Foundation’s humanitarian mission**:  
- Aid for civilians suffering under siege in Gaza  
- Educational projects for vulnerable communities  
- Relief efforts where needed most  

Our more than **100% donation model**: all admin costs are covered by trustees, so every penny donated goes directly to the cause.
